When hacking a game system
--------------------------

Before hacking (change/add/remove rules in) the game, always ask yourself the following questions and answer them truthfully and thoughtfully:

* Why am I doing this? More precisely:
  * How should the game work? (How should the mechanic under review behave under the core principle/aesthetic of the game?) [eg. D&D is, at its core, about player choice, resolution by dice throw and consequence. All of the game mechanics should therefore follow this principle unless there is a very good overriding reason rooted in aesthetics.]
  * Why doesn't the game work as expected? (Why don't the current rules of the game obey the conclusions of the previous question?) [eg. saving throws run counter to the main theme of player choice - they are a dice roll forced by an external force, and not as a result of one's own choice. More mechanically, they are an unwarranted exception to the system, one that must be pointed out every time it occurs.]
  * Prove that the game doesn't work as expected.
* Why didn't the game designers do it? (What, if any, are the hidden pitfalls of implementing this change?)
* Why is this the best way to do it? (Isn't there a smaller change that would produce the same effect?)

Design Aesthetics
-----------------

*Challenge* is the experience of applying your skills to overcome obstacles and challenges and ultimately to win. Challenge relies on a sense of fairness, that the playerâ€™s choices can affect the outcome.

*Discovery* is the experience of uncovering unknown and unexpected things

*Expression* is the experience of creating things are unique expressions of your imagination.

*Fantasy* is the experience of being a part of an imaginary world. It is escapism.

*Fellowship* is the experience of being part of a team, group, or social circle.

*Narrative* is experiencing a well-told, well-structured story. It is often confused with fantasy. But they are very different experiences.

*Sensory pleasure* is experiencing and appreciating things you can see, touch, hear, or otherwise perceive. Eg. artwork, handouts, feelies, miniatures, and maps.

*Subjugation* is the experience of shutting off your brain and losing yourself in an effortless activity. Eg. grinding through simple combats in video games or mining endlessly for resources.
