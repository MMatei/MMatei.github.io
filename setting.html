<h1 align="center">Frozen Realms</h1><br/>
<p>What we call 'Frozen Realms' is known as Neveria to its inhabitants. It is a world immersed in magic, where civilizations rise and fall in a seemingly endless cycle of change. The world is always in some sort of upheaval, and so it is littered with unexplored locations, ancient ruins filled with terrible horrors and tremendous treasure, cosmopolitan cities with wondrous buildings and, of course, plenty of monsters and trouble for brave adventurers to confront.</p>
<p>Neveria has two continents. Devon is by far the largest, and all known civilizations make their home here. Trax is smaller, covered in a hostile jungle, and home only to ruins and devastating monsters and pestilences. It was only recently discovered and little is known about it.</p>

<br/><h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>Alignment is a core concept of the theology of Neveria, with each Deity unwaveringly commited to a particular moral stance by which it acts and to which it holds its followers. Alignment is therefore a set of morals, that generally define how a creature judges situations. As far as the deities (and even some rare spells) are concerned, all creatures of Neveria fall into one of nine alignments, and the fate of one's soul after death is tightly bound to one's perceived alignment. Of course, no mortal creatures is in any way tightly bound by this arbitrary classificiation, and its morality is its own choice, but these infinite details of each individual are of no concern to the powers that be.</p>
<p>Alignment is decided solely by your actions in the world. The Deities you worship and the philosophy you might claim to hold dear have no bearing. There are two measures that define alignment: selfishness (how much a creature values its own well-beign at the expense of others') and lawfulness (the value a creature places on order - laws both written and unwritten). From these measures arose nine broad categories, as follows:</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful.</i></b> You value order above all else. Laws must be obeyed regardless of how unpleasant they may be, even to oneself. Morality is irrelevant against the greater conflict of order against chaos, and you believe that any measure is justified in order to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Selfless.</i></b> You place great stock in an ordered society, but only so long as it benefits all of its members. Unjust laws should be changed, not indiscriminately applied.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Selfish.</i></b> Without order, society would crumble; but order also requires that the best - like yourself - remain distinctly advantaged to fulfill your full potential.</p>
<p><b><i>Selfless.</i></b> Compassion is paramount to you, and you would do almost anything to help a fellow in need. All that is important is for everyone to live peacefully side by side, and questions of law or freedom are secondary to the need for everyone's well being.</p>
<p><b><i>Selfish.</i></b> All that is important to you is your personal well-being, all else be damned. You obey the law when it is convenient, break it when it is not, and are willing to consort with anyone and do anything if it only advances your goals.</p>
<p><b><i>Unaligned.</i></b> You have no moral compass of any sort, or perhaps you just don't want to bother with such questions. You do whatever feels right, and hold no strong moral beliefs. Creatures that are not sentient always fall in this category, unless they are magically forced to behave in a particular way.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Selfless.</i></b> You are a rebel with a cause, dedicated to helping others, but also with a grudge against authority. You deeply mistrust authority, and will only collaborate with it when people's lives are at stake.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Selfish.</i></b> You despise order and seek your own personal gain in a free for all where only the strongest can prosper.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic.</i></b> You reject morality as inventions of a rigid society intent only on perpetuating itself. You embrace total freedom, at the expense of everything else. Nothing is, or should be, sacred. Perhaps you just want to see the old world burn.</p>

<br/><h4>Deities</h4>
<p>There are 9 major Deities, known and worshiped all throughout the world, irreverently known as the Big Nine. Their powers are great thanks to the vast number of their faithful, which in turn helps them project their power and gain more followers. Whenever some great upheaval occurs, you can be near certain a major Deity or another is behind it.</p>
<p>There are also a fair number of minor Deities, patrons of narrow portfolios that are of interest to some communities. Many of these minor Deities are worshiped only by specific cultures or races. Their power varies with the faith they receive, but is generally quite minor compared to the Big Nine. If they are completely forgotten, they remain little more than above average spirits chained to their former places of worship. They may yet recover their power with new worshipers, or they may fade altogether if the last of their altars is destroyed.</p>
<p>It is said that even Deities can die, although only faint rumors exist on the subject, and even these talk only of forgotten Deities, weakened by a lack of followers.</p>
<p>Minor Deities are more likely to answer the pleas of their faithful, not only because there are less of them to manage, but also because it's in their best interest to keep their followers interested. A minor Deity will quite often walk the Material Plane, interact with worshipers, and even put all of their might behind the needs of a particularly devout follower. Their full might, however powerful by mortal standards, isn't enough, however, to challenge the very fabric of existence, and wherever a major Deity is concerned, a minor one is helpless.</p>
<p>In contrast, major Deities can do almost anything they put their mind to, but they are far more aloof to their follower's requests. This is part of the reason minor Deities still have a following at all. Generally, minor Deities pledge allegiance to one of the Big Nine, thus receiving a place in their respective major Deities' astral realm. This also comes with other advantages, such as their temples and followers being tolerated by followers of that particular important Deity. Although a mortal can provide faith to as many Deities as he/she believes in, Deities can get fairly territorial about their faithful and all except the most selfless frequently engage in turf wars.</p><br/>

</table><br/>
<p><b><i>Ammun</i></b> believes that order must reign supreme over all else, with morality secondary to the stability granted by unyielding law. Any deviation from the ideal must be swiftly and harshly punished, for law alone can safeguard the mortals from evil. He is particularly popular among monarchs and aristocrats, for he looks kindly upon a stratified and rigid social order. Ammun frequently bestows a divine mandate upon monarchs who earn his favor, thus cementing their rule against usurpers.</p>
<p>Ammun is a jealous deity, and He admits few competitors for his faith. He has a few subordinate minor Deities, but their cults are merely tolerated, not promoted. He rarely makes any kind of agreement with the other Deities, and generally orders his followers to purge worshipers of other Gods, especially the chaotic ones.</p>
<p><b><i>Cuthbert</i></b> is among the most popular of minor Deities, for he enforces oaths made before his altar. Should anyone be foolish enough to renege on such an oath, Cuthbert would soon appear to smack some sense into the offender with his holy mace. The light from his mace compels all creatures to be honest, and He also enforces honesty on all that is said before his altars.</p>
<p><b><i>Shingen</i></b> is the archetype of the honorable warrior, and he enforces a strict code of conduct according to which war is to be fought. After all, warfare without order is just senseless violence and chaos unworthy of devotees of Order.</p>
<p><b><i>Melammu</i></b> is a kind Goddess and patron of justice - one that seeks to be proportionate with the crime and to encourage rehabilitation. In fact, Melammu often encourages Her adepts to forgive their enemies and help them see the light. Melammu is also a patron of all types of water, and as such is worshiped by sailors.</p>
<p>Melammu is closely associated with <b><i>Marianna</i></b>, Goddess of Peace and Mercy, whose cult is very firmly centered on pacifism, forgiveness and tolerance of all. Marianna was a blameless priestess of Melammu who performed many miracles in her life, and who died while trying to reconcile two communities on the verge of conflict. She was ascended by the Goddess on the spot, and this final miracle brought peace to that troubled land.</p>
<p><b><i>Rigantia</i></b> beckons Her followers to follow the lure of adventure wherever it might lead, bravely forging on no matter the risks. To stand still, unchanging, is to die before one's time, She teaches. This makes her very popular with nomads, and she has few permanent temples. Her clergy usually travel around the world, lending a helping hand where they are needed. She encourages her faithful to help others in need heedless of consequences, and she is particularly opposed to tyrants and oppressors.</p>
<p>A close ally of Rigantia is the halfling Goddess <b><i>Ogma</i></b>, patron of songs and tales. Peculiarly for a racial Deity, Ogma is also worshiped by other races, particularly by bards, playwrights, poets and other artists.</p>
<p><b><i>Otana</i></b> is cold and calculated, rarely answering prayers and requests as She likes to let Her followers be challenged; furthermore, albeit ironically, She emphasizes reasoning over faith. When She does speak, it is in riddles and obscure references that challenge the mind. She values knowledge and an open mind above all else, and Her temples double as impressive libraries and centers of enlightenment. She believes in educating others, in sharing knowledge, not hoarding it.</p>
<p><b><i>Darun-Nurad</i></b> is a hermaphrodite Deity, with a male face on one side, and a female face on the other side of the head. It favors no particular moral stance, teaching that truth cannot be found in this world, only the next. Involvement in the affairs of others should be avoided, for one never knows if an intervention will ultimately bring good or ill. Darun-Nurad enjoys paradoxes, who It believes are the only way to bring one to the ultimate revelation, that good and evil are two sides of the same coin (a doctrine firmly rejected by all other Deities). It is a reclusive Deity, intervening mostly to ensure that balance between good and evil is maintained. Rarely, It also takes interest in certain individuals, whom It attempts to guide to the 'truth' via odd visions, apparitions, and adventures.</p>
<p><b><i>Tenebros</i></b> is the implacable God of Death and Time. He makes certain that all that lives also dies, that time eventually ends for all. He will sometimes grant glimpses of time to his followers, but he is resolutely opposed to time being manipulated for any reason. He can grant undeath to select and devout followers of his, but only to expand their lifespan, not to grant them immortality. He appreciates ambition, but not of the unlimited variety; he instead emphasises one's legacy for the future. Tenebros appreciates knowledge, but more as a measure of one's worth - and he does not think one is worthy of knowing that which one cannot find on one's own.</p>
<p><b><i>Vecna</i></b> is closely associated with Tenebros as a guardian of secrets - in particular the secret of undeath. Vecna was once the greatest lich to ever exist, rumored to have gathered all the knowledge of the world. As a reward, Tenebros allowed him to ascend to godhood and take a place in Tenebros' realm.</p>
<p><b><i>Ladugar</i></b> is the dwarven God of industry, that is to say hard and inovative work. Ladugar promotes constant progress, norms and traditions be damned, and he exhorts his followers to never be idle, but constantly toil for the betterment of their race. Most hill and mountain dwarves shun Ladugar because of his disdain for tradition and the other dwarven Gods. The grey dwarves of the Underdark, however, pray only to Him, for He delivered them from the oppression of the mind flayers.</p>
<p><b><i>Hel</i></b> (sometimes also known as the Dark Mistress to her cultists) is a patron of all who wish to gain and maintain power over others. She loves seducing people into aspiring for greater power, deluding them with dreams of serving their people, obtaining vengeance, or simply being famed throughout history. She loves ambition above all, although she does enforce a hierarchy which permits only limited in-fighting. She is a master over the devils, whom she keeps on a tight leash, always wary of her own position being usurped.</p>
<p>The leader of all devils is the sly Asmodeus, who constantly plots to invade and conquer the Material Plane. But although he is a very powerful devil, he is not a minor Deity and has no worshipers, for Hel will not allow it, fearful perhaps of the threat that the archdevil could pose if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Sometimes elevated to the honor of Hel's right hand, <b><i>Iuz</i></b> is always hatching some evil scheme, and he frequently visits the material plane as a harmless old man. In this disguise he lures unwary adventurers to their deaths, or to unwittingly perform acts of evil. Iuz is a trickster par excellence, and he seldom settles for straightforward plans.</p>
<p>Another reliable ally of Hel is <b><i>Hathor</i></b>, who employs her powers of seduction to create or demolish kingdoms. She is the head of fanatically devoted hedonistic cult, that is capable of unspeakable evil in exhcange for the gift of eternal unblemished beauty.</p>
<p><b><i>Orcus</i></b> began as an overly ambitious demon lord, who sought supreme power. Thus he turned to the necrotic powers of the Shadowfell, which transfigured him into a horrifying abomination with massive powers over death and undeath that rival those of Vecna. He pledges allegiance to no major deity, although he sometimes allies with Hel or Ashur for short-term gain. He has an ongoing rivalry with another powerful demon lord, Demogorgon, who has perhaps foiled as many of his plans as adventurers.</p>
<p><b><i>Loki</i></b> is the fickle God of Fire, Freedom and Revelry. He does not recognize hierarchy, and is always of help to rebels and the opressed. He encourages his followers to fight, drink, and live like there is no tommorow. He also enjoys mischief, and frequently employs trickery against the other Deities purely for his own amusement.</p>
<p><b><i>Ashur</i></b> is the God of Destruction and War, a force of pure chaos that loves only destruction and is quite likely to turn on His own followers if it provides a better spectacle. Only the mad and the desperate turn to the worship of Ashur, for though He is known for bringing victory in battle, He is also known for His insatiable bloodlust and desire to see the whole world burn. Strangely enough, He sometimes abandons his followers for years, even decades at a time, though He inevitably returns, his appetite for slaughter never dimmed.</p>
<p>Ashur commands an infinite array of demons, their combined power incalculable. Some of the stronger demons are minor Deities in their own right, and they scheme and visit destruction upon the mortal world. These facts lead some sages to speculate that Ashur may be the strongest of the Deities, and that only some indeterminate force is holding Him back from destroying the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Lolth</i></b> is among Ashur's most infamous servants. As mistress of the Drow, she has led wars aplenty against the people of the surface. She revels in pain, and cares not one whit if it comes from enemies or her own servants, and she is quick to send her dreaded spider monstrosities against her Drow faithful should they fail her. Like all notable demon lords, Lolth is intensely ambitious, and will seize any opportunity to aggrandize herself.</p>
<p>Another infamous demon lord, and the most powerful by his own reckoning, is Demogorgon, who proclaims himself to be 'Prince of the Demons'. He is not a minor Deity, even though he does have a few mad cultists every now and then, but he is indeed a powerful demon. Not only is his grotesque physical form (with scaly skin, a very long lizard's tail and a monkey's head) immensely powerful, but he also commands the allegiance of several lesser demon lords. It is said that Demogorgon aims to force all other demon lords to kneel before him, so that he can proclaim himself as King of the Abyss, and lead it on a rampage against the Material Plane.</p>
<p><b><i>Yeenoghu</i></b> may be lesser known, but he is no less powerful for it. Both demon lord and minor deity of gnolls, Yeenoghu is sometimes worshipped by the desperate, who see a twisted form of relief in the embrace of his eternal hunger. He is the creator of both gnolls and ghouls, and he delights in unleashing his minions in feeding frenzies that consume entire nations. There can never be enough flesh to sate Yeenoghu's hunger, but this does not prevent him from driving his worshippers insane with craving for all that can be eaten, but intelligent flesh most of all.</p>


<br/><h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The continent of Devon stretches for vast distances and is filled by many wondrous civilizations, as well as countless more ruined civilizations. Only the major Deities are constant in its landscape.</p>
<p>On the north-western coast of Devon stretches the feudal Kingdom of Erathia, founded from the moribound remnants of the once great Mydasian Empire, which covered most of the Western part of the continent until its collapse in the face of repeated invasions by nomads from the East and barbarian tribes from the north. Erathia considers itself as a successor to the legacy of Mydas, although its power is nothing compared to that of the old Empire. Furthermore, it doesn't even hold the old capital of Mydas, once the greatest city in the world, now a ruin haunted by the undead once summoned in its defense.</p>
<p>Sinburg is the capital city of Erathia, and by far the biggest city in the Kingdom, owing to its perfect position astride major trade routes. It has an excellent natural harbor that greatly encourages sea trade, and it also guards the entrance to the Vitari River, the best route of transportation for goods from the Starmetal Hills. The other famous city of Erathia is Verbobonc, about a hundred kilometers to the south-east, capital of the powerful Duchy of Verbobonc.</p>
<p>To the north of Erathia lies the Empire of Perm, which also considers itself a successor to the Mydasian Empire, even though it holds none of the territories once ruled from Mydas. Perm is, however, a very large nation, that grew to encompass all of the barbarian tribes of the north. Its northernmost reaches are sparsely populated and poor, but the climate breeds a hardy people that have earned a fearsome reputation for the Permian army. The southern reaches of the Empire are fertile, and its serfs are tied to their fields, barely better off than slaves. This is a great source of wealth for Perm, who can therefore afford expensive military campaigns to extend its reach.</p>
<p>To the east of Erathia lie hills and mountains rich in ore, home to the dwarves of the Deut Commonwealth. Once willing subjects of the Mydasian Empire, they are now fiercely independent, even to the point of xenophobia. The Deut are fanatical about efficiency and productivity, even by dwarven standards, a stance hardened by the collapse of Mydas, which the dwarves attribute to a lack in productivity. As a result, the Deut cities banded together in a Commonwealth, ruled by a triumvirate of their most accomplished craftsdwarves.<br/>
<p>The Deut pride themselves on the top notch quality of their products. Massive forges enhaced with technological optimizations produce unmatched quantities of goods that are highly sought by all neighboring nations. The Deut have created an impressive network of tunnels between their cities, all in a bid to improve the productivity of their forges, as they send requisite materials by rail to where they're needed. But this growing industry has created an unsatiable lust for resources, and dark rumors abound that the Deut are no longer content with their ore deposits and that they're preparing to claim neighboring lands by force.</p>
<p>A particularly tempting target is the Gnomish Confederation, nestled in the Starmetal Hills that are split between the two races. Gnomes and dwarves have always colaborated, with great results, even after the collapse of the Empire that sheltered them both. However, the hunger for resources might cloud memories of this historic friendship.</p>
<p>To the South-East of Erathia and just below the Starmetal Hills lies the United Lordships of Enroth, a peculiar human nation which began as an alliance of nobles rebelling against the authority of the Erathian king. The rebellion was ultimately successful, and this event marked the end of Erathia's expansion. The Lords of Enroth are worshippers of Marianna and they believe that there should be no great gap between social classes. The peasants of Enroth are all free landowners, who pay comparatively little in taxes, and must instead muster in defense of the realm. This allows the nation to raise a fairly large and strong army at a moment's notice. This has enabled the nation to resist its considerably larger neighbor so far.</p>
<p>South of Erathia, and separated by the Spear Mountains, lies the Kingdom of Avlee, an unusual alliance of wood elves and hill dwarves joined together by a desire for mutual protection against a hostile world. The Kingdom is more than satisfied to isolate itself from the world, and there is only a weak trade link between Avlee and Erathia.</p>

<br/><h4>Magic</h4>
<p>Whatever its source or manner of casting, all magic behaves similarly once cast, pointing to a common origin, or at least a common explanation for all magic. Some clerics hotly contest this matter, eager to enforce the superiority of the Divine over mortal magic, but there is no denying that a wizard's antimagic field can supress all kinds of magic equally effectively. That said, there are a number of different methods to produce magic, each with its own quirks.</p>
<p>First, but not foremost, there is Divine magic, which is powered by a specific Deity. Every God or Goddess is a massive fount of magic, some of which can be directed towards their loyal followers. People who devote their lives to a Deity and show great devotion and talent in its service may receive the gift of magic, and thus become Clerics of that particular Deity. Their magic is completely conditioned on their service to their Deity, and they must pray daily in order to recharge their magical energies. Clerics cast spells by means of short prayers and devotional thoughts.</p>
<p>Paladins also draw strength from a Deity, but not as directly as clerics do. Paladins swear an oath before a Deity, an oath which proscribes a strict code of conduct, but also bestows Divine power upon them. It is a paladin's belief in this oath and their determination to see their holy mission completed which enables them to draw power from their Deity without requiring constant prayer. Paladins are creatures of action, not words, and so only strength of will is used in order to cast their spells. Whereas clerics are like extensions of their Deity's will, paladins like are free agents hired on its behalf. If a paladin's belief in his mission ever slackens, he will lose his powers, and he must find a new mission to subscribe to (or find a new path altogether).</p>
<p>The second kind of magic source is the Weave, from which most magic users derive their powers. The Weave connects the Material Plane with the Elemental and Energetic Spheres, providing a way for those in the know to tap the vast reservoires of natural power of the planet. Wizards claim that Deities too draw their power from the Weave, while clerics claim that the Deities created the Weave, as a gift for mortals to be able to freely use magic. It is called thusly because it behaves similarly to a fabric, thicker in some places, torn in others. Threads of the Weave are used when casting, so it is indeed possible to void an area of magic, if only temporarily. There are, however, cursed places where the Weave has been so violently shredded that it shies from entering again (or at least not for many centuries). Antimagic fields can also block the Weave.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the Weave to cast arcane spells. All that is required is intensive study of the precise gestures, words, materials, and mental projections required to successfuly cast a spell. Not many have the patience and strong memory to engage in such an effort, not to mention the opportunity or money to study all that is required, which is why magic is a fairly rare occurrence. Wizards, arcane knights and arcane tricksters all use this way of casting spells, which requires constant study to refresh the complex details of each and every spell.</p>
<p>Sorcerers are folks lucky enough to have been born with an innate connection to the Weave. They are a small fount of magic, and they can draw on their own power to cast spells, instead of essentially coaxing the Weave to cooperate with elaborate rituals. Sorcerers cast spells through sheer will alone, although it may still be necessary to use a word, gesture or material in order to focus the magic properly.</p>
<p>Warlocks have found another way to skip all the bothersome study: find a powerful being willing to strike a bargain - magic power and knowledge in exchange for... cooperation. Warlocks thus become artificial sorcerers, but only by the grace of their patron. Should the relationship ever be severed, a warlock would lose all of his powers. Furthermore, depending on the type of patron, the warlock can acquire certain special powers, though at the cost of the immense flexibility of true sorcerers.</p>
<p>Bards exploit yet another trick of the Weave, namely that music seems to hold some special power over it, especially when a performer puts his soul into it. Bards are very similar to wizards, except that they study songs instead of formulas. Naturally, this means bards will rarely, if ever, reach the same reality-altering powers as the wizards, but they have instead tapped into the more mundane (yet surprisingly effective) powers of song to inspire emotions in other creatures.</p>
<p>Druids and rangers attune to the Weave in ways similar to a cleric attunes to his Deity. By living in harmony with the world, they can establish an almost intuitional connection with the Weave, and can draw on it almost as naturally as sorcerers. Unlike them, however, druids and rangers must constantly refresh their connection with nature, which they must respect and protect. Those who connect with the world in this way lean towards a less strict view of morality, though they also firmly reject evil for personal gain, as well as any action that might harm the natural order. (In other words, Selfish or Chaotic aren't permitted as alignments; if a druid or ranger changes to a forbidden alignment, they automatically lose all of their powers)</p>
<p>Druids have small shrines scattered throughout deep wilderness, where they perform occasional rituals to honor Mother Nature. Druids rarely pay any homage to the Deities, and most view them as usurpers, products of mortal faith, and not as creators of the world.</p>
<p>Monks can also draw on a limited form of innate magic. Unlike with sorcerers, this 'ki', as it is called, is rigorously trained over years and years and rarely achieves the potency of natural talent. Ki sits somewhere between sorcerer and druid magic, in fact, as the monk must remain in tune with his body and his surroundings in order to employ his ki techniques.</p>

<br/><h4>The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>Existence is split in a number of enveloping spheres, that can be broadly split into three Realms: Inner, Middle and Outer. The Inner Realm consists of the following spheres (in order): Elemental Sphere, Energetic Sphere and Ethereal Sphere. The Middle Realm consists solely of the Material Sphere. The Outer Realm consists of the following spheres (in order): Astral Sphere, Divine Sphere and Exosphere.</p>
<p>The Elemental Sphere contains the basic building blocks of the world: Earth, Fire, Air and Water. Each element covers a fourth of the sphere and borders all the others. Most of these realms consist of the purest form of the element, but interesting features form at the borders between elements. These borders are generally bearable for mortals and can therefore be safely visited. Elementals inhabit these planes, with some of them organizing themselves into beautiful cities, whose architectural wonders would be impossible in the mortal world. Most famous of these is the efreeti City of Brass, which is completely cosntructed from the eponymous material.</p>
<center style="padding:2em;"><img src="images/inner_realm.svg" style="height:auto;"/>
<p>(Conceptual map of the Energetic Sphere superimposed over the Elemental Sphere)</p></center>
<p>The Energetic Sphere is split into two halves: the Feywild and the Shadowfell, one representing life and the other representing death. The Energetic Sphere draws from the raw power of the elements and shapes them into the complex cycle of life and death. This sphere therefore interacts strongly with the one below it, and the Elemental Sphere is visibly affected by the Feywild or Shadowfell in certain places (for example, the desolate Salt Desert is influenced by the Shadowfell).</p>
<p>The Feywild is a verdant and luxuriously lush garden, called home by a vast number of magical plants and creatures. It is the source of the biotic energy that infuses all life and promotes its growth. Biotic energy being so powerful here, there is no patch of land that does not support some form of life. Death is rare and comes only by way of foul magic winds from the Shadowfell. This plane is ruled over by the Fey, primordial manifestations of biotic energy, who build extensive palaces out of the dense forests. Two Queens hold rival Fey courts, one of Summer and the other of Winter, but their rivalry is less a matter of different morals and more a matter of pride and personal conflict between the two Queens. The Fey who pledge allegiance to the Summer Court are known as Seelie Fey, and they tend to be somewhat more selfless than those who are loyal to the Winter Court, called Unseelie Fey. Not all Fey are aligned to one of these courts. All Fey have a child-like nature: curious, capricious and playful - they enjoy playing pranks on mortals, and can be offended by those who do not play along.</p>
<p>The Shadowfell is the source of death and necrotic energy, so it stands in stark contrast to the Feywild: it is a desolate landscape haunted by shadowy creatures that are half alive, half dead. Some thoroughly evil creatures that enjoy dealing with necrotic energy make their home on this plane - for example Orcus, the self-proclaimed Prince of Undeath. Some life escapes from the Feywild only to become twisted, diseased, and shortly die. Madmen and outcasts may make a living here, painful and depressed, but the place is mostly inhabited by roving undead. Unlike the undead of the material plane, these creatures are created from pure necrotic energy alone, and they have no link to a soul that provides memories or purpose.</p>
<p>Ruins and endless graveyards litter the Shadowfell, wounds of death bleeding from the Material Plane. Powerful shadows may exist here, devouring any living thing foolish enough to enter. The Shadowfell is the domain of the Reaper, a mysterious creature that sages believe to be the incarnation of death. The Reaper is said to personally sever the links between souls and bodies when it is a creature's appointed time to die, and to briefly take them to the Shadowfell before releasing them into death. No one has ever seen the Reaper and lived to tell the tale, so not much is known about it, except that it seems to be no friend of Orcus.</p>
<p>The Ethereal Sphere is the border between the Middle and Inner Realms and it has no recognizable geography. All we know about it is that it is divided between a Border Ethereal and a Deep Ethereal. The Border Ethereal is like a foggy, slightly distorted version of the material world. The Border Ethereal is easily accessible to a number of magical creatures and spells. It is quite possible to see into it and from it, and to walk into and out of it. Access into the Deep Ethereal is more difficult, and there appears to be nothing of interest here. It is very easy to get lost in the endless fog, permanently shifting colors, that is this plane. With just a bit more effort, however, one can pass through the Ethereal Sphere altogether and reach the Energetic or Elemental Spheres below.</p>

<p>The Divine Sphere is split into 9 different planes, each home to a specific Major Deity, alongside a number of allied Minor Deities. These divine planes are: the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus (Lawful), the Blessed Fields of Elysium (Selfless), the Wild Grove of Arborea (Chaotic Selfless), the Spiral Library of Arcadia (Lawful Selfless), the Infinite Gardens of Mount Celestia (Unaligned), the Silent Fields of Limbo (Lawful Selfish), the Nine Hells of Baator (Selfish), the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna (Chaotic Selfish) and the Bottomless Abyss (Chaotic). All these planes are tied together by the Infinite Staircase, and they are floating (in a manner of speaking) in the Astral Sphere. Entrances to the staircase litter the Planes, but they are very well hidden and often guarded by powerful creatures. The appearance of the Staircase itself shifts as it traverses the Planes, ranging from nondescript stone masonry, to a jumble of platforms that float in nothingness.</p>
<p>The appearance of each Divine Plane is subject to the whim of its patron Deity, and the chaotic ones often have no permanent form. Furthermore, attempts to open a portal to these planes must have the approval of the patron Deity in order to succeed.</p>
<p>Baator is home to the vast array of Devils, Hel's footsoldiers, led by the tyrannical Asmodeus, who legends say aspires to the throne of Godhood. All the unfortunate souls who go to Baator are transformed into Lemures, wretched wormlike creatures that are doomed to suffer at the hands of the other devils, at least until they are promoted to imps, to serve the Devils. Devils follow a rigid hierarchy, with those that distinguish themselves promoted, while those that disobey or disappoint their leaders getting demoted.</p>
<p>Gehenna is a curious place, home both to the undead and the evil yuggoloths. Most of Gehenna is a rocky wasteland covered in dead and undead, but here and there one can find the hiding places of the yuggoloths where they await, sages say, the call to battle of the Ultimate General, the greatest of the ultroloths.</p>
<p>The Abyss is home to the devils, who are always infinitely many and thoroughly devoted to the destruction of all. The Abyss also boasts infinitely many layers, each with its own leader. Some of them are Minor Deities, and relatively well known for their nefarious schemes, while others remain still unknown. The sages say that the layers are constantly at war with each other, each seeking to impose its dominance over the others, and that this is the only reason while a demonic invasion hasn't yet scoured all life from this world.</p>
<p>The Exosphere is the outermost layer of existence, and it consists of detritus of matter and energy that gradually dissipates into the Void. There are no direct pathways to the Exosphere, and only lost travelers end up here. This is a dangerous place, as it can give way to the lifeless Void without warning, spelling doom for the unwary. The Void beyond contains no life and can support none. Not even spirits tread here, and there are rumors that even magic begins to fizzle and dissipate as it encounters the Void...</p>
<p>Fragments of anicent texts speak of a Far Realm that would lie beyond the Void, or perhaps parallel to existence. It is written that this is a twisted dimension, beholden to rules that are wholly different to those that define our existence. Only madness is to be found in this Far Realm, and if ever a breach is opened to our world, only madness and destruction follows. It is said that desperate or mad warlocks have found ways to make pacts with beings from this dimension, but what, other than horror and madness could be the end of such a pact?</p>

<br/><h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, and goes to abide on the plane that best corresponds to its behavior in life (alignment). Praying to a deity that doesn't fit your alignment doesn't alter this basic fact in any way. Minor Deities usually have subdomains in the Plane representing their alignment, where they gather their followers.</p>
<p>The exact details of a soul's stay in the Astral Plane, as well as the connection to its former body are poorly understood. However, it is known that it is impossible to resurrect those dead for more than 200 years, and also that it is impossible to resurrect those that died of old age. Furthermore, resurrection can only be done with the express approval of the soul, who knows exactly who is trying to bring it back (including alignment and patron deity, if any). The cadaver of the deceased must also be available, or it must be completely destroyed (in which case very powerful magic is required to rebuild it). This means that if a creature has been transformed into an undead, resurrection is impossible until the undead has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The reasons behind all these restrictions are a matter of considerable debate. To those who consider the authority of the deities to be paramount, this is their will and therefore the natural order of things - the creatures of the Material Plane are meant to be mortal, with only their immaterial soul worthy of being uplifted into the presence of the deities. Death is a natural and unavoidable part of life, while undeath and necrotic energy are tools of evil and violations of the sacred order.</p>
<p>Rumours persist among the wizards, however, that it is possible to breach the gates of the heavens and visit the Astral Plane even while still bound to one's material body. Therefore, they contend, the body is merely a vessel for the soul - one that can readily be exited and entered. There are even dangerous whispers that souls are trapped after death, unable to leave the domain of their God, imprisoned in fact, in a shell just as restrictive as the mortal body.</p>
<p>On death, the body may either be disposed by burning or exposure, or buried. Cultures where necromancy is sanctioned employ burial, since it creates a convenient strategic reserve of bodies to animate. Other cultures bury their dead in the curious belief that souls need a body in order to continue their existence, and that if their body is destroyed, then the soul will eventually disintegrate. Monuments to or mementos of the dead are to be found in almost every culture, however, for the pain of losing a loved one is felt by all cultures equally.</p>
<p>Most cultures, especially those mortals who are short-lived, have a deep resentment and fear of death. The dead are greatly mourned and respectfully treated, and their burial places are viewed as sacred. As such, raising the dead is outright banned and generally punishable by death. It doesn't help necromancy's case that the necrotic energy it employs stands in antithesis to the biotic energy found in all life, a fact most people take to mean that only evil people could possibly employ it. Necrotic energy does indeed come from the Shadowfell, but it does not taint anyone who is not already tainted. Unfortunately, many practitioners of animancy use it in a selfish manner, further fueling the suspicion of the common folk.</p>
<p>Although animated undead aren't intelligent and don't carry any portion of their owner's soul, they do maintain a link to that soul, which enables them to share some of their memories. This is what allows undead to carry out basic tasks without the need for elaborate instructions from their master. Furthermore, when bereft of a master, undead may carry out some routine that they used to perform in life; for example, a guard may patrol a hallway, a potter may endlessly spin a phantom pottery wheel etc.</p>
<p>This link works both ways, and souls are intensely aware of what happens to their animated bodies. This is a further reason why necromancy is so frowned upon when done to unwilling subjects (and no devotees of 'good' Deities are willing subjects).</p>
<p>Being animated by necrotic energy, undead are affected by any biotic energy as if it were corrosive, and they suffer force damage. This fact gave rise to the cheapest, and most common, weapon against undead: holy water. Every cleric worth his salt knows a ritual that can bless water and infuse it with biotic energy.</p>

<br/><h4>The Paladin Oaths</h4>
<p><i><b>Oath of Devotion.</b> I swear to devote my whole life, body and soul to the service of Law, Order, and Civilization. Henceforth, and until final death claims my soul, my every waking momement, my every breath shall be bound to this sacred duty. My honesty shall light even the most shadowy of deceits. My bravery shall stand fast even before the most trying of horrors. My commitment to Law and to the rightful order shall be unyielding. For I am a Paladin of Ammun. I am Truth. I am Courage. I am Law. I am Devotion.</i></p>
<p>The Oath of Devotion is strict and unyielding, and only followers of Ammun are rigid enough to swear it. There isn't much room for compassion in this oath, and its paladins are known more as travelling judges than as defenders of the downtrodden.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of the Ancients.</b> I swear to forever serve as a bearer of Light that beats back the Darkness, wherever it might be found. I will kindle the Light in others. I will defend the Light from encroaching Darkness. I will preserve and nourish my own Light, and make it a beacon that brings hope and joy into the most bereavered of hearts.</i></p>
<p>Placing a strong emphasis on compassion and the joy of life, Paladins who swear the Oath of the Ancients are generally the optimistic sort, who travel a lot, aiming to reduce suffering as much as they can. It can be a fairly thankless job, of course, and it is perhaps the Oath that spurs the most disillusionment. Perhaps the most well-known Order that follows this Oath is the Holy Order of Saintly Maria the Humble. These paladins swear an additional oath of poverty, pledging all their earnings to the benefit of the needy.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Vengeance.</b> I swear to never rest until all evil is cleansed from this world. Wherever evil sprouts, I shall strike it down, no matter the cost to myself, and without mercy to those who have committed their lives to evil, for evil must be destroyed. I shall allow no barriers to hold me from delivering just vengeance, for evil must be destroyed. For all the ill that it has wrought, I will find it and smite it, for I am vengeance and evil must be destroyed.</i></p>
<p>Vengeance is arguably not the most noble of paladin oaths, as its adherents are more concerned with the destruction of evil than with the well-being of common beings. If the destruction of a greater evil requires cooperation with a lesser evil, then so be it. If innoncents must die in order to defeat a great villain, then so be it. This is the philosophy of Vengeance: victory at all costs, as the utter destruction of evil is its only goal.</p>
<p>This means that a wide range of characters are attracted to this type of oath, from the chaotic good that want to end evil without recourse to stifling legal process, to the neutral types, that don't so much want to do good, as are interested in the destruction of a particular villain, or group of villains. Many a wronged youth has sworn an Oath of Vengeance in the aftermath of personal tragedy. Needless to say, not all of these quests end well.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Power.</b> Good and evil are lies; there is no morality. Life is absurd and knows no distinctions and no fate, save that which we forge ourselves. Power, and the courage and skill to wield it, are the only truths. I am power incarnate, the bane of my enemies, and I make my own truth.</i></p>
<p>The oath of a paladin can be quite burdensome, and not everyone endures this trial without blemish. Those who are at wit's end may renounce their oaths and become Oathbreakers, bereft of their paladin powers. But some aren't content with this state of affairs and they strike a deal with one of the evil Deities, to gain new powers, in exchange for allegiance to the powers of evil. Hel also greatly enjoys seducing noble paladins into Her service, and She will place temptations in the path of those She deems to be wavering in their faith.</p>
<p>Orders of paladins dedicated to this oath tend to be few and short-lived, for if the forces of good don't destroy them, they are liable to destroy themselves via infighting. But when they do thrive, such orders can be very fearsome forces, bending entire nations to their will and destorying entire armies for the glory of Hel.</p>

<br/><h4>The Calendar of Harptos</h4>
<p>Most civilizations of the Frozen Realms now agree on a single calendar, which was first invented by the Wizard-King Harptos, founder of the Mydasian Empire, about a millennia ago. He imposed this calendar on all the regions he conquered, eager to standardize all measures in his new, centralized nation.</p>
<p>Each year has 365 days (corresponding to the time it takes for the planet to revolve around the Sun). There are three months for every season, for a total of 12 months, 30 days each. Five special holidays fall in between the months, marking the passage into a new season. The Shieldsmeet is a special holiday, that is inserted into the calendar every four years to account for leap years.</p><br/>
