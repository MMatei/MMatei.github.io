<h1 align="center">Frozen Realms</h1><br/>
<p>What we call 'Frozen Realms' is known as Neveria to its inhabitants. It is a world immersed in magic, where civilizations rise and fall in a seemingly endless cycle of change. The world is always in some sort of upheaval, and so it is littered with unexplored locations, ancient ruins filled with terrible horrors and tremendous treasure, cosmopolitan cities with wondrous buildings and, of course, plenty of monsters and trouble for brave adventurers to confront.</p>
<p>Neveria has two continents. Devon is by far the largest, and all known civilizations make their home here. Trax is smaller, covered in a hostile jungle, and home only to ruins and devastating monsters and pestilences. It was only recently discovered and little is known about it.</p>

<br/><h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>Alignment is a label that the Universe places on every living thing, roughly describing the philosophy by which that creature lives its life. It can be arbitrary and rigid at times, but this is the way that the Universe works. Alignment is chiefly important in determining what happens to your soul after <a href="#death">death</a>, while some magics and creatures judge another by its ascribed alignment.</p>
<p>Alignment is decided by your actions in the world. The Deities you worship and the philosophy you espouse have no bearing. Succinctly put, alignment measures two characteristics in a creature: its lawfulness (obedience to rules) and its morality (general behavior towards other creatures; being considerate towards others is 'good', while being selfish is 'evil'). In somewhat more detail (but by no means complete), the alignments are:</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Good (LG).</i></b> You always follow the rules, no matter how hard it might be to you to do so. You also try your best to help others, though only if it's proper under society's rules and restrictions.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral Good (NG).</i></b> You are compassionate, always with an eye towards providing the best for everybody. If rules get in the way, then they are not just and they should be changed, and you won't let yourself be thus restricted from helping those in need. However, you consider society and its norms to be an important part of sentient life; we just need to work constantly on improving it.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Good (CG).</i></b> You value your freedom highly and you don't like bowing before authority. You feel good about helping others, but you won't necessarily go out of your way to do so. When friends are in peril though, you will stop at nothing to help them.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Neutral (LN).</i></b> You want order and logic in your life, and these concern you more than matters of morality. So what if some people are suffering? This is the system, it works, and it's the only thing separating us from base beasts. You'll probably help another, especially a friend, but never if it means going against the lawful order.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral (N).</i></b> Morality? Order? Sheer nonsense all of it. Life is too complex to be crammed into such restrictive categories. You make your own way, independent of the petty labels of other sentients and seek a greater truth in life.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Neutral (CN).</i></b> You're an anarchist, fiercely individualistic, and would band together with others only out of self-interest. You'd stick your neck out for your friends, but you don't care much about strangers.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Evil (LE).</i></b> You're only interested in the well-being of your own group. Relations within this group can take a remarkable number of forms. Maybe it's family, or a friendship forged through trials and tribulations, or even unyielding love. Within this group, you abide by laws and norms, and those who break them are dealt with harshly. Even outside this group, you still have some rules or compunctions, which you deem very important, as they separate you from a common criminal.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral Evil (NE).</i></b> You are selfish through and through, and you do anything you can get away with. You have little regard for hierarchies, although you may accept them as necessary. There is always a concrete purpose to your evil deeds, however, sometimes even a relatable one, such as orphans stealing to make a living.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Evil (CE).</i></b> This is a complex category. Perhaps you are insane, and can no longer adequately distinguish morality. Perhaps you are sadistic, relishing in the pain you inflict upon others. Or perhaps you're just a broken person, viewing life as absurd and not worthy of higher standards of conduct. Regardless of motive, you visit destruction upon any in your path, and consort with few others, if any.</p>

<br/><h4>Deities</h4>
<p>There are 9 major Deities, known and worshiped all throughout the world. Their powers are great thanks to the vast number of their worshipers, which in turn helps them project their power and gain more worshipers. Whenever some great upheaval occurs, you can be near certain a major Deity or another is behind it.</p>
<p>Then there are many more minor Deities, patrons of specific domains or worshiped only by specific cultures (Elven Deities, Dwarven Deities etc). Their power varies with the faith they receive. If they are completely forgotten, they remain little more than above average spirits chained to their former places of worship. They may yet recover their power with new worshipers, or they may fade altogether if the last of their altars is destroyed.</p>
<p>It is said that even Deities can die, although only faint rumors exist on the subject, and even those talk only of forgotten Deities, weakened by a lack of worshipers.</p>
<p>Minor Deities are more likely to answer the pleas of their faithful, not only because there are less of them to manage, but also because it's in their best interest to keep their followers faithful. A minor Deity will quite often walk the Material Plane, interact with worshipers, and even put all of their might behind the needs of a particularly devout follower. Their full might, however powerful by mortal standards, isn't enough, however, to challenge the very fabric of existence, and wherever a major Deity is concerned, a minor one is helpless.<br/>
<p>In contrast, major Deities can do almost anything they put their mind to, but they are far more aloof to their follower's requests. This is part of the reason minor Deities still have a following at all.</p><br/>

</table><br/>
<p>Bhagavan believes in a very strict and unyielding interpretation of what is good. Everything remotely evil must be harshly punished, for law alone is the boundary between good and evil.</p>
<p>Melammu has an altogether more kind view of justice, that seeks to be proportionate with the crime and to encourage rehabilitation. In fact, Melammu often encourages Her adepts to forgive their enemies and help them see the light. She has a daughter, Marianna, Goddess of Rivers and Mercy, whose cult is very firmly centered on pacifism, forgiveness and tolerance of all.</p>
<p>Rigantia beckons Her followers to follow the lure of adventure wherever it might lead. All in need should be aided, no matter the cost and with little regard for consequences. This carefree attitude often places Her followers at odds with those who worship Bhagavan and His strict ways.</p>
<p>Otana is cold and calculated, rarely answering prayers and requests as She likes to let Her followers be challenged; furthermore, albeit ironically, She emphasizes reasoning over faith. When She does speak, it is in riddles and obscure references that challenge the mind.</p>
<p>Darun-Nurad is a two-headed hermaphrodite Deity, who favors ascetic individuals who walk a very narrow path between good and evil. Darun-Nurad enjoys paradoxes, who It believes are the only way to bring one to the ultimate revelation, that good and evil are two sides of the same coin (a doctrine rejected by both good and evil Deities and clergy). It is a reclusive Deity, intervening mostly to ensure that balance between good and evil is maintained. Rarely, It also takes interest in certain individuals, whom It attempts to guide to the 'truth' via odd visions, apparitions, and adventures.</p>
<p>Loki's sole purpose in life is to see laughter (or more often, enjoy a good laugh at the expense of the mortals). Loki will often start a whole chain of improbable events for the sole purpose of constructing a humorous scenario for his enjoyment. One must be very careful when praying to Loki, for He enjoys granting wishes in a twisted way that mock the original intent.</p>
<p>Hel (sometimes also known as the Dark Mistress) is a patron of all who wish to gain and maintain power over others. She loves seducing people into aspiring for greater power, deluding them with dreams of serving their people, obtaining vengeance, or simply being famed throughout history. She loves ambition above all, though all her followers must abide by a strict chain of command, which She insists is the only path to success.</p>
<p>Tenebros (also called Lord of the Night by some cults) is a patron of undead as well as occasional help for those who wish to glimpse into the future or the past. He doesn't care much for evil deeds, but does encourage His followers to blanket the land with death, for it is sweet and dear to Him. Cheating death past one's normal lifespan is anathema to Tenebros, so He will scheme and employ his Divine wrath against such transgressors. The only exception, which only He or foul powers aligned with Him will grant, is undeath, but that comes at the price of eternal servitude.</p>
<p>Ashur is the God of Destruction and War, a force of pure chaos that loves only destruction and is quite likely to turn on His own followers if it provides a better spectacle. Only the mad and the desperate turn to the worship of Ashur, for though He is known for bringing victory in battle, He is also known for His insatiable bloodlust and desire to see the whole world burn. Strangely enough, He sometimes breaks into melancholy and abandons his followers for years, even decades at a time, though He inevitably returns.</p>

<br/><h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The continent of Devon stretches for vast distances and is filled by many wondrous civilizations, as well as countless more ruined civilizations. Only the major Deities are constant in its landscape.</p>
<p>On the north-western coast of Devon stretches the feudal Kingdom of Elamia, founded from the moribound remnants of the once great Mydasian Empire, which covered most of the Western part of the continent until its collapse in the face of repeated invasions by nomads from the East and barbarian tribes from the North. Elamia considers itself as a successor to the legacy of Mydas, although its power is nothing compared to that of the old Empire. Furthermore, it doesn't even hold the old capital of Mydas, once the greatest city in the world, now a ruin haunted by the undead once summoned in its defense.</p>
<p>Sinburg is the capital city of Elamia, and by far the biggest city in the Kingdom, owing to its perfect position astride major trade routes. It has an excellent natural harbor that greatly encourages sea trade, and it also guards the entrance to the Vitari River, the best route of transportation for goods from the Starmetal Hills. The other famous city of Elamia is Verbobonc, about a hundred kilometers to the South-East, capital of the powerful Duchy of Verbobonc.</p>
<p>To the North of Elamia lies the Empire of Perm, which also considers itself a successor to the Mydasian Empire, even though it holds none of the territories once ruled from Mydas. Perm is, however, a very large nation, that grew to encompass all of the barbarian tribes of the North. Its northernmost reaches are sparsely populated and poor, but the climate breeds a hardy people that have earned a fearsome reputation for the Permian army. The southern reaches of the Empire are fertile, and its serfs are tied to their fields, barely better off than slaves. This is a great source of wealth for Perm, who can therefore afford expensive military campaigns to extend its reach.</p>
<p>To the East of Elamia lie hills and mountains rich in ore, home to the dwarves of the Deut Commonwealth. Once willing subjects of the Mydasian Empire, they are now fiercely independent, even to the point of xenophobia. The Deut are fanatical about efficiency and productivity, even by dwarven standards, a stance hardened by the collapse of Mydas, which the dwarves attribute to a lack in productivity. As a result, the Deut cities banded together in a Commonwealth, ruled by a triumvirate of their most accomplished craftsdwarves.<br/>
<p>The Deut pride themselves on the top notch quality of their products. Massive forges enhaced with technological optimizations produce unmatched quantities of goods that are highly sought by all neighboring nations. The Deut have created an impressive network of tunnels between their cities, all in a bid to improve the productivity of their forges, as they send requisite materials by rail to where they're needed. But this growing industry has created an unsatiable lust for resources, and dark rumors abound that the Deut are no longer content with their ore deposits and that they're preparing to claim neighboring lands by force.</p>
<p>A particularly tempting target is the Gnomish Confederation, nestled in the Starmetal Hills that are split between the two races. Gnomes and dwarves have always colaborated, with great results, even after the collapse of the Empire that sheltered them both. However, the hunger for resources might cloud memories of this historic friendship.</p>
<p>South of Elamia, and separated by the Spear Mountains, lies the Elven Kingdom of Celesta, which seems content to isolate itself from the world. Trade with the Kingdom has been in steady decline, and not just because the passes of the Spear Mountains have grown infested with goblinoids.</p>

<br/><h4>The source of magic</h4>
<p>There are three sources of magical energy in Neveria: the Deities, the Weave and the planet itself.</p>
<p><b><i>The Deities.</i></b> Having created this world, They are the source of Magic, and they can bestow this power upon those who are faithful to them. Clerics and paladins must all dedicate themselves to a specific Deity in order to use magic, and their power is always contingent on the favor of their chosen Deity. It is, however, possible for a cleric or paladin to switch allegiance, although new patrons always test such converts thoroughly. Paladins, however, follow some very strict oaths, and are warriors for a cause. As such, their alignment is limited to LG - Oath of Devotion, NG - Oath of the Ancients, CG - Oath of Vengeance, LE - Oath of Dread. (Neutral alignments have yet to inspire a career in their defense; and NE and CE are so morally bankrupt as to leave no room for a Paladin's oath)</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Magic.</i></b> The Weave represents threads of Magic that permeate all planes. It is called thusly because it behaves similarly to a fabric, thicker in some places, torn in others. Threads of the Weave are used when casting, so it is indeed possible to void an area of magic, if only temporarily. There are, however, cursed places where the Weave has been so violently shredded that it shies from entering again (or at least not for many centuries). Antimagic fields can also block the Weave. Wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, bards, arcane knights and arcane tricksters all use the Weave to power their spells, which are commonly known as arcane spells.</p>
<p><b><i>Magic from Nature.</i></b> Countless centuries of magic use has saturated the land with magic, so much so, that those who are willing to open themselves up to the world, and view it as a living organism, can gain a little of this power. Unlike the Weave, this power is constant everywhere on the Material Plane. Those who take their power from Nature, however, don't feel at home on the other Planes of existence, and they can't restore any of their powers while there. Druids and Rangers power their magic from the land. This source of magic isn't intrinsically different from the Weave; it's more a matter of personal philosophy. Those who connect with the world in this way lean towards a less strict view of morality, though they also firmly reject evil for personal gain, as well as any action that might harm the natural order. (In other words, CE and NE aren't permitted as alignments, and LE only as a "means excuses the end" type of personality; if a druid or ranger changes to a forbidden alignment, they automatically lose all of their powers)</p>
<p>Druids have small shrines scattered throughout deep wilderness, where they perform occasional rituals to honor Mother Nature. Druids rarely pay any homage to the Deities, and most view them as usurpers, products of mortal faith, and not as creators of the world.</p>

<br/><h4>The Paladin Oaths</h4>
<p><i><b>Oath of Devotion.</b> I swear to devote my whole life, body and soul to the service of Law, Order, and Civilization. Henceforth, and until final death claims my soul, my every waking momement, my every breath shall be bound to this sacred duty. My honesty shall light even the most shadowy of deceits. My bravery shall stand fast even before the most trying of horrors. My commitment to Law and to the rightful order shall be unyielding. For I am a Paladin of Bhagavan. I am Truth. I am Courage. I am Law. I am Devotion.</i></p>
<p>The Oath of Devotion is strict and unyielding, and only followers of Bhagavan are rigid enough to swear it. There isn't much room for compassion in this oath, and its paladins are known more as travelling judges than as defenders of the downtrodden.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of the Ancients.</b> I swear to forever serve as a bearer of Light that beats back the Darkness, wherever it might be found. I will kindle the Light in others. I will defend the Light from encroaching Darkness. I will preserve and nourish my own Light, and make it a beacon that brings hope and joy into the most bereavered of hearts.</i></p>
<p>Placing a strong emphasis on compassion and the joy of life, Paladins who swear the Oath of the Ancients are generally the optimistic sort, who travel a lot, aiming to reduce suffering as much as they can. It can be a fairly thankless job, of course, and it is perhaps the Oath that spurs the most disillusionment. Perhaps the most well-known Order that follows this Oath is the Holy Order of Saintly Maria the Humble. These paladins swear an additional oath of poverty, pledging all their earnings to the benefit of the needy.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Vengeance.</b> I swear to never rest until all evil is cleansed from this world. Wherever evil sprouts, I shall strike it down, no matter the cost to myself, and without mercy to those who have committed their lives to evil, for evil must be destroyed. I shall allow no barriers to hold me from delivering just vengeance, for evil must be destroyed. For all the ill that it has wrought, I will find it and smite it, for I am vengeance and evil must be destroyed.</i></p>
<p>Vengeance is arguably not the most noble of paladin oaths, as its adherents are more concerned with the destruction of evil than with the well-being of common beings. If the destruction of a greater evil requires cooperation with a lesser evil, then so be it. If innoncents must die in order to defeat a great villain, then so be it. This is the philosophy of Vengeance: victory at all costs, as the utter destruction of evil is its only goal.</p>
<p>This means that a wide range of characters are attracted to this type of oath, from the chaotic good that want to end evil without recourse to stifling legal process, to the neutral types, that don't so much want to do good, as are interested in the destruction of a particular villain, or group of villains. Many a wronged youth has sworn an Oath of Vengeance in the aftermath of personal tragedy. Needless to say, not all of these quests end well.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Power.</b> Good and evil are lies; there is no morality. Life is absurd and knows no distinctions and no fate, save that which we forge ourselves. Power, and the courage and skill to wield it, are the only truths. I am power incarnate, the bane of my enemies, and I make my own truth.</i></p>
<p>The oath of a paladin can be quite burdensome, and not everyone endures this trial without blemish. Those who are at wit's end may renounce their oaths and become Oathbreakers, bereft of their paladin powers. But some aren't content with this state of affairs and they strike a deal with one of the evil Deities, to gain new powers, in exchange for allegiance to the powers of evil. Hel also greatly enjoys seducing noble paladins into Her service, and She will place temptations in the path of those She deems to be wavering in their faith.</p>
<p>There is no order of evil paladins, for by the very nature of their oath, they take poorly to authority, unless they are the ones exercising it. Some evil paladins scour the land, completing dark missions for their Deity, while others gather a warband around them and proceed to impose their power over the land.</p>
<p>One peculiarity of the Oath of Power is that it provides some measure of power over the undead, regardless of the dark deity the paladin now serves. Why this is so the scholars cannot agree, though it should be mentioned that Undeath has never been the sole purview of Tenebros (most notably, the minor deity Orcus calls himself Prince of Undeath, a title that doesn't sit well with Tenebros).</p>

<br/><h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, and goes to abide on the plane that best corresponds to its behavior in life (alignment). Praying to a Deity that doesn't fit your alignment doesn't alter this basic fact in any way. Minor Deities usually have subdomains in these Planes, where they gather their followers.</p>
<p>Magic makes it possible to bring a soul back from the Astral Plane, although this can only be done with the express approval of the soul, who knows exactly who is trying to bring it back (including alignment and patron deity, if any). The cadaver of the deceased must also be available, or it must be completely destroyed (in which case very powerful magic is required to rebuild it). This means that if a creature has been transformed into an undead, resurrection is impossible until the undead has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Necromancy isn't intrinsically evil, but it is generally seen as such, because it deals with negative energies and death. Negative energy comes from the Shadowfell, and it's an antithesis to the positive energy that is found in all life. As such, those who use it are psychically scarred, their outlook on life constantly darkened to the point where they lose all sense of morality. This scarring is proportionate with one's use of negative energy. If employed sparingly, then it is no more than an occasional shadow on one's soul. But those who call often upon this dark force inevitably descend into an emotional abyss, from which it's impossible to escape, even for the strong-willed.</p>
<p>But aside from the downsides of employing negative energy, raising the dead is also seen as taboo in most societies, for it is seen as disrespectful to the dead. Remember that a soul always knows what is happening with its body, and that pious creatures may be horrified to know that their bodies are used in such a way. It certainly doesn't help that almost all necromancers are known for vile and terrible deeds.</p>
<p>Although animated undead aren't intelligent and don't carry any portion of their owner's soul, they do maintain a link to that soul, which enables them to share some of their memories. This is what allows undead to carry out basic tasks without the need for elaborate instructions from their master. Furthermore, when bereft of a master, undead may carry out some routine that they used to perform in life; for example, a guard may patrol a hallway, a potter may endlessly spin a phantom pottery wheel etc.</p>
<p>Being animated by negative energy, undead are affected by any positive energy as if it were acid. Thus, healing will do damage to an undead. This also gave rise to the cheapest, and most common, weapon against undead: holy water. Clerics of good deities have rituals that can bless water, infusing it with positive energy.</p>

<br/><h4>The Calendar of Harptos</h4>
<p>Most civilizations of the Frozen Realms now agree on a single calendar, which was first invented by the Wizard-King Harptos, founder of the Mydasian Empire, about a millennia ago. He imposed this calendar on all the regions he conquered, eager to standardize all measures in his new, centralized nation.</p>
<p>Each year has 365 days (corresponding to the time it takes for the planet to revolve around the Sun). There are three months for every season, for a total of 12 months, 30 days each. Five special holidays fall in between the months, marking the passage into a new season. The Shieldsmeet is a special holiday, that is inserted into the calendar every four years to account for leap years.</p><br/>

<br/><h4>The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>The Material Plane, the physical world we exist in, lies at the center of a great sphere. Immediately surrounding the world lie the Inner Planes, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane (which also contains the mystical realms of Shadowfell and Feywind). Then come the Outer Planes, linked by the Outlands.</p>
<p>The Inner Planes are home to the raw and untamed elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Air. They form a continuous whole, with interesting features forming at the borders between regions.</p>
<p>Each Outer Plane is home to a specific Major Deity, alongside a number of associated Minor Deities. In order, these planes are: the Peaceable Kingdom of Arcadia (LG), the Blessed Fields of Elysium (NG), the Wild Grove of Arborea (CG), the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus(LN), the Infinite Gardens of Mount Celestia (N), the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (CN), the Nine Hells of Baator (LE), the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna (NE) and the Bottomless Abyss (CE).</p>
<p>The appearance of an Outer Plane is subject to the whim of its patron Deity, and the chaotic ones often have no permanent form. Furthermore, attempts to open a portal to these planes must have the approval of the patron Deity in order to succeed.</p>
<p>All of the Outer Planes are connected by the Infinite Staircase. Entrances to the staircase litter the Planes, but they are very well hidden and often guarded by powerful creatures. The appearance of the Staircase itself shifts as it traverses the Planes, ranging from nondescript stone masonry, to a jumble of platforms that float in nothingness.</p>
<p>Baator is home to the vast array of Devils, Hel's footsoldiers, led by the tyrannical Asmodeus, who legends say aspires to the throne of Godhood. All the unfortunate souls who go to Baator are transformed into Lemures, wretched wormlike creatures that are doomed to suffer at the hands of the other devils, at least until they are promoted to imps, to serve the Devils. Devils follow a rigid hierarchy, with those that distinguish themselves promoted, while those that disobey or disappoint their leaders getting demoted.</p>
<p>Gehenna is a curious place, home both to the undead and the evil yuggoloths. Most of Gehenna is a bleak wasteland covered in dead and undead, but here and there one can find the hiding places of the yuggoloths where they await, sages say, the call to battle of the Ultimate General, the greatest of the ultroloths.</p>
<p>The Abyss is home to the devils, who are always infinitely many and thoroughly devoted to the destruction of all. The Abyss also boasts infinitely many layers, each with its own leader. Some of them are Minor Deities, and relatively well known for their nefarious schemes, while others remain still unknown. The sages say that the layers are constantly at war with each other, each seeking to impose its dominance over the others, and that this is the only reason while a demonic invasion hasn't yet scoured all life from this world...</p>
