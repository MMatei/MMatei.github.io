<h1 align="center">Frozen Realms</h1><br/>
<p>What we call 'Frozen Realms' is known as Neveria to its inhabitants. It is a world immersed in magic, where civilizations rise and fall in a seemingly endless cycle of change. The world is always in some sort of upheaval, and so it is littered with unexplored locations, ancient ruins filled with terrible horrors and tremendous treasure, cosmopolitan cities with wondrous buildings and, of course, plenty of monsters and trouble for brave adventurers to confront.</p>
<p>Neveria has two continents. Devon is by far the largest, and all known civilizations make their home here. Trax is smaller, covered in a hostile jungle, and home only to ruins and devastating monsters and pestilences. It was only recently discovered and little is known about it.</p>

<br/><h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>Alignment is a label that the Universe places on every living thing, roughly describing the philosophy by which that creature lives its life. It can be arbitrary and rigid at times, but this is the way that the Universe works. Alignment is chiefly important in determining what happens to your soul after <a href="#death">death</a>, while some magics and creatures judge another by its ascribed alignment.</p>
<p>Alignment is decided by your actions in the world. The Deities you worship and the philosophy you espouse have no bearing. Succinctly put, alignment measures two characteristics in a creature: its lawfulness (obedience to rules) and its morality (general behavior towards other creatures; being considerate towards others is 'good', while being selfish is 'evil'). With three grades for every axis, there are nine alignments:</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Good (LG).</i></b> You always follow the rules, no matter how hard it might be for you to do so. You also try your best to help others, though only if it's proper under society's rules and restrictions.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral Good (NG).</i></b> You are compassionate, always with an eye towards providing the best for everybody. If rules get in the way, then they are not just and they should be changed, and you won't let yourself be thus restricted from helping those in need. However, you consider society and its norms to be an important part of sentient life; we just need to work constantly on improving it.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Good (CG).</i></b> You value your freedom highly and you don't like bowing before authority. You feel good about helping others, but you won't necessarily go out of your way to do so. When friends are in peril though, you will stop at nothing to help them.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Neutral (LN).</i></b> You want order and logic in your life, and these concern you more than matters of morality. So what if some people are suffering? This is the system, it works, and it's the only thing separating us from base beasts. You'll probably help another, especially a friend, but never if it means going against the lawful order.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral (N).</i></b> Morality? Order? Sheer nonsense all of it. Life is too complex to be crammed into such restrictive categories. You make your own way, independent of the petty labels of the other sentients. You seek a greater truth in life.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Neutral (CN).</i></b> You're an anarchist, fiercely individualistic, and would band together with others only out of self-interest. You'd stick your neck out for your friends, but you don't care much about strangers.</p>
<p><b><i>Lawful Evil (LE).</i></b> You're only interested in the well-being of your own group. Relations within this group can take a remarkable number of forms. Maybe it's family, or a friendship forged through trials and tribulations, or even unyielding love. Within this group, you abide by laws and norms, and those who break them are dealt with harshly. Even outside this group, you still have some rules or compunctions, which you deem very important, as they separate you from a common criminal.</p>
<p><b><i>Neutral Evil (NE).</i></b> You are selfish through and through, and you do anything you can get away with. You have little regard for hierarchies, although you may accept them as necessary. There is always a concrete purpose to your evil deeds, however, sometimes even a relatable one, such as orphans stealing to make a living.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic Evil (CE).</i></b> This is a complex category. Perhaps you are insane, and can no longer adequately distinguish morality. Perhaps you are sadistic, relishing in the pain you inflict upon others. Or perhaps you're just a broken person, viewing life as absurd and not worthy of higher standards of conduct. Regardless of motive, you visit destruction upon any in your path, and consort with few others, if any.</p>

<br/><h4>Deities</h4>
<p>There are 9 major Deities, known and worshiped all throughout the world. Their powers are great thanks to the vast number of their worshipers, which in turn helps them project their power and gain more worshipers. Whenever some great upheaval occurs, you can be near certain a major Deity or another is behind it.</p>
<p>Then there are many more minor Deities, patrons of specific domains or worshiped only by specific cultures (Elven Deities, Dwarven Deities etc). Their power varies with the faith they receive. If they are completely forgotten, they remain little more than above average spirits chained to their former places of worship. They may yet recover their power with new worshipers, or they may fade altogether if the last of their altars is destroyed.</p>
<p>It is said that even Deities can die, although only faint rumors exist on the subject, and even those talk only of forgotten Deities, weakened by a lack of worshipers.</p>
<p>Minor Deities are more likely to answer the pleas of their faithful, not only because there are less of them to manage, but also because it's in their best interest to keep their followers faithful. A minor Deity will quite often walk the Material Plane, interact with worshipers, and even put all of their might behind the needs of a particularly devout follower. Their full might, however powerful by mortal standards, isn't enough, however, to challenge the very fabric of existence, and wherever a major Deity is concerned, a minor one is helpless.<br/>
<p>In contrast, major Deities can do almost anything they put their mind to, but they are far more aloof to their follower's requests. This is part of the reason minor Deities still have a following at all.</p><br/>

</table><br/>
<p>Bhagavan believes in a very strict and unyielding interpretation of what is good. Everything remotely evil must be harshly punished, for law alone is the boundary between good and evil.</p>
<p>Melammu has an altogether more kind view of justice, that seeks to be proportionate with the crime and to encourage rehabilitation. In fact, Melammu often encourages Her adepts to forgive their enemies and help them see the light. She has a daughter, Marianna, Goddess of Rivers and Mercy, whose cult is very firmly centered on pacifism, forgiveness and tolerance of all.</p>
<p>Rigantia beckons Her followers to follow the lure of adventure wherever it might lead. All in need should be aided, no matter the cost and with little regard for consequences. This carefree attitude often places Her followers at odds with those who worship Bhagavan and His strict ways.</p>
<p>Otana is cold and calculated, rarely answering prayers and requests as She likes to let Her followers be challenged; furthermore, albeit ironically, She emphasizes reasoning over faith. When She does speak, it is in riddles and obscure references that challenge the mind.</p>
<p>Darun-Nurad is a two-headed hermaphrodite Deity, who favors ascetic individuals who walk a very narrow path between good and evil. Darun-Nurad enjoys paradoxes, who It believes are the only way to bring one to the ultimate revelation, that good and evil are two sides of the same coin (a doctrine rejected by both good and evil Deities and clergy). It is a reclusive Deity, intervening mostly to ensure that balance between good and evil is maintained. Rarely, It also takes interest in certain individuals, whom It attempts to guide to the 'truth' via odd visions, apparitions, and adventures.</p>
<p>Loki's sole purpose in life is to see laughter (or more often, enjoy a good laugh at the expense of the mortals). Loki will often start a whole chain of improbable events for the sole purpose of constructing a humorous scenario for his enjoyment. One must be very careful when praying to Loki, for He enjoys granting wishes in a twisted way that mock the original intent.</p>
<p>Hel (sometimes also known as the Dark Mistress) is a patron of all who wish to gain and maintain power over others. She loves seducing people into aspiring for greater power, deluding them with dreams of serving their people, obtaining vengeance, or simply being famed throughout history. She loves ambition above all, though all her followers must abide by a strict chain of command, which She insists is the only path to success.</p>
<p>Tenebros (also called Lord of the Night by some cults) is a patron of undead as well as occasional help for those who wish to glimpse into the future or the past. He doesn't care much for evil deeds, but does encourage His followers to blanket the land with death, for it is sweet and dear to Him. Cheating death past one's normal lifespan is anathema to Tenebros, so He will scheme and employ his Divine wrath against such transgressors. The only exception, which only He or foul powers aligned with Him will grant, is undeath, but that comes with the price of eternal servitude.</p>
<p>Ashur is the God of Destruction and War, a force of pure chaos that loves only destruction and is quite likely to turn on His own followers if it provides a better spectacle. Only the mad and the desperate turn to the worship of Ashur, for though He is known for bringing victory in battle, He is also known for His insatiable bloodlust and desire to see the whole world burn. Strangely enough, He sometimes abandons his followers for years, even decades at a time, though He inevitably returns, his appetite for slaughter never dimmed.</p>

<br/><h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The continent of Devon stretches for vast distances and is filled by many wondrous civilizations, as well as countless more ruined civilizations. Only the major Deities are constant in its landscape.</p>
<p>On the north-western coast of Devon stretches the feudal Kingdom of Elamia, founded from the moribound remnants of the once great Mydasian Empire, which covered most of the Western part of the continent until its collapse in the face of repeated invasions by nomads from the East and barbarian tribes from the north. Elamia considers itself as a successor to the legacy of Mydas, although its power is nothing compared to that of the old Empire. Furthermore, it doesn't even hold the old capital of Mydas, once the greatest city in the world, now a ruin haunted by the undead once summoned in its defense.</p>
<p>Sinburg is the capital city of Elamia, and by far the biggest city in the Kingdom, owing to its perfect position astride major trade routes. It has an excellent natural harbor that greatly encourages sea trade, and it also guards the entrance to the Vitari River, the best route of transportation for goods from the Starmetal Hills. The other famous city of Elamia is Verbobonc, about a hundred kilometers to the south-east, capital of the powerful Duchy of Verbobonc.</p>
<p>To the north of Elamia lies the Empire of Perm, which also considers itself a successor to the Mydasian Empire, even though it holds none of the territories once ruled from Mydas. Perm is, however, a very large nation, that grew to encompass all of the barbarian tribes of the north. Its northernmost reaches are sparsely populated and poor, but the climate breeds a hardy people that have earned a fearsome reputation for the Permian army. The southern reaches of the Empire are fertile, and its serfs are tied to their fields, barely better off than slaves. This is a great source of wealth for Perm, who can therefore afford expensive military campaigns to extend its reach.</p>
<p>To the east of Elamia lie hills and mountains rich in ore, home to the dwarves of the Deut Commonwealth. Once willing subjects of the Mydasian Empire, they are now fiercely independent, even to the point of xenophobia. The Deut are fanatical about efficiency and productivity, even by dwarven standards, a stance hardened by the collapse of Mydas, which the dwarves attribute to a lack in productivity. As a result, the Deut cities banded together in a Commonwealth, ruled by a triumvirate of their most accomplished craftsdwarves.<br/>
<p>The Deut pride themselves on the top notch quality of their products. Massive forges enhaced with technological optimizations produce unmatched quantities of goods that are highly sought by all neighboring nations. The Deut have created an impressive network of tunnels between their cities, all in a bid to improve the productivity of their forges, as they send requisite materials by rail to where they're needed. But this growing industry has created an unsatiable lust for resources, and dark rumors abound that the Deut are no longer content with their ore deposits and that they're preparing to claim neighboring lands by force.</p>
<p>A particularly tempting target is the Gnomish Confederation, nestled in the Starmetal Hills that are split between the two races. Gnomes and dwarves have always colaborated, with great results, even after the collapse of the Empire that sheltered them both. However, the hunger for resources might cloud memories of this historic friendship.</p>
<p>South of Elamia, and separated by the Spear Mountains, lies the Elven Kingdom of Celesta, which seems content to isolate itself from the world. Trade with the Kingdom has been in steady decline, and not just because the passes of the Spear Mountains have grown infested with goblinoids.</p>

<br/><h4>Magic</h4>
<p>Whatever its source or manner of casting, all magic behaves similarly once cast, pointing to a common origin, or at least a common explanation for all magic. Some clerics hotly contest this matter, eager to enforce the superiority of the Divine over mortal magic, but there is no denying that a wizard's antimagic field can supress all kinds of magic equally effectively. That said, there are a number of different methods to produce magic, each with its own quirks.</p>
<p>First, but not foremost, there is Divine magic, which is powered by a specific Deity. Every God or Goddess is a massive fount of magic, some of which can be directed towards their loyal followers. People who devote their lives to a Deity and show great devotion and talent in its service may receive the gift of magic, and thus become Clerics of that particular Deity. Their magic is completely conditioned on their service to their Deity, and they must pray daily in order to recharge their magical energies. Clerics cast spells by means of short prayers and devotional thoughts.</p>
<p>Paladins also draw strength from a Deity, but not as directly as clerics do. Paladins swear an oath before a Deity, an oath which proscribes a strict code of conduct, but also bestows Divine power upon them. It is a paladin's belief in this oath and their determination to see their holy mission completed which enables them to draw power from their Deity without requiring constant prayer. Paladins are creatures of action, not words, and so only strength of will is used in order to cast their spells. Whereas clerics are like extensions of their Deity's will, paladins like are free agents hired on its behalf. If a paladin's belief in his mission ever slackens, he will lose his powers, and he must find a new mission to subscribe to (or find a new path altogether).</p>
<p>The second kind of magic source is the Weave, from which most magic users derive their powers. The Weave connects the Material Plane with the Elemental and Energetic Spheres, providing a way for those in the know to tap the vast reservoires of natural power of the planet. Wizards claim that Deities too draw their power from the Weave, while clerics claim that the Deities created the Weave, as a gift for mortals to be able to freely use magic. It is called thusly because it behaves similarly to a fabric, thicker in some places, torn in others. Threads of the Weave are used when casting, so it is indeed possible to void an area of magic, if only temporarily. There are, however, cursed places where the Weave has been so violently shredded that it shies from entering again (or at least not for many centuries). Antimagic fields can also block the Weave.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the Weave to cast arcane spells. All that is required is intensive study of the precise gestures, words, materials, and mental projections required to successfuly cast a spell. Not many have the patience and strong memory to engage in such an effort, not to mention the opportunity or money to study all that is required, which is why magic is a fairly rare occurrence. Wizards, arcane knights and arcane tricksters all use this way of casting spells, which requires constant study to refresh the complex details of each and every spell.</p>
<p>Sorcerers are folks lucky enough to have been born with an innate connection to the Weave. They are a small fount of magic, and they can draw on their own power to cast spells, instead of essentially coaxing the Weave to cooperate with elaborate rituals. Sorcerers cast spells through sheer will alone, although it may still be necessary to use a word, gesture or material in order to focus the magic properly.</p>
<p>Warlocks have found another way to skip all the bothersome study: find a powerful being willing to strike a bargain - magic power and knowledge in exchange for... cooperation. Warlocks thus become artificial sorcerers, but only by the grace of their patron. Should the relationship ever be severed, a warlock would lose all of his powers. Furthermore, depending on the type of patron, the warlock can acquire certain special powers, though at the cost of the immense flexibility of true sorcerers.</p>
<p>Bards exploit yet another trick of the Weave, namely that music seems to hold some special power over it, especially when a performer puts his soul into it. Bards are very similar to wizards, except that they study songs instead of formulas. Naturally, this means bards will rarely, if ever, reach the same reality-altering powers as the wizards, but they have instead tapped into the more mundane (yet surprisingly effective) powers of song to inspire emotions in other creatures.</p>
<p>Druids and rangers attune to the Weave in ways similar to a cleric attunes to his Deity. By living in harmony with the world, they can establish an almost intuitional connection with the Weave, and can draw on it almost as naturally as sorcerers. Unlike them, however, druids and rangers must constantly refresh their connection with nature, which they must respect and protect. Those who connect with the world in this way lean towards a less strict view of morality, though they also firmly reject evil for personal gain, as well as any action that might harm the natural order. (In other words, CE and NE aren't permitted as alignments, and LE only as a "means excuses the end" type of personality; if a druid or ranger changes to a forbidden alignment, they automatically lose all of their powers)</p>
<p>Druids have small shrines scattered throughout deep wilderness, where they perform occasional rituals to honor Mother Nature. Druids rarely pay any homage to the Deities, and most view them as usurpers, products of mortal faith, and not as creators of the world.</p>
<p>Monks can also draw on a limited form of innate magic. Unlike with sorcerers, this 'ki', as it is called, is rigorously trained over years and years and rarely achieves the potency of natural talent. Ki sits somewhere between sorcerer and druid magic, in fact, as the monk must remain in tune with his body and his surroundings in order to employ his ki techniques.</p>

<br/><h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, and goes to abide on the plane that best corresponds to its behavior in life (alignment). Praying to a deity that doesn't fit your alignment doesn't alter this basic fact in any way. Minor Deities usually have subdomains in the Plane representing their alignment, where they gather their followers.</p>
<p>The exact details of a soul's stay in the Astral Plane, as well as the connection to its former body are poorly understood, however. It is known that it is impossible to resurrect those dead for more than 200 years, and also that it is impossible to resurrect those that died of old age. Furthermore, resurrection can only be done with the express approval of the soul, who knows exactly who is trying to bring it back (including alignment and patron deity, if any). The cadaver of the deceased must also be available, or it must be completely destroyed (in which case very powerful magic is required to rebuild it). This means that if a creature has been transformed into an undead, resurrection is impossible until the undead has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The reasons behind all these restrictions are a matter of considerable debate. To those who consider the authority of the deities to be paramount, this is their will and therefore the natural order of things - the creatures of the Material Plane are meant to be mortal, with only their immaterial soul worthy of being uplifted into the presence of the deities. Death is a natural and unavoidable part of life, while undeath and necrotic energy are tools of evil and violations of the sacred order.</p>
<p>Rumours persist among the wizards, however, that it is possible to breach the gates of Heaven and visit the Astral Plane even while still bound to one's material body. Therefore, they contend, the body is merely a vessel for the soul; and a vessel than can readily be exited and entered. There are even dangerous whispers that souls are trapped after death, unable to leave the domain of their God, imprisoned in fact, in a shell more restricting than the mortal body.</p>
<p>Burial rites are observed throughout most of the world's civilizations for varying reasons, though a most interesting belief in some places is that souls need a body in order to continue their existence, and that if their body is destroyed, then the soul will eventually disintegrate.</p>
<p>Most cultures have a deep resentment of death, however, and a reverence for their dead. As such, raising the dead is outright banned and generally punishable by death. It doesn't help necromancy's case that the necrotic energy it employs stands in antithesis to the biotic energy found in all life, and that prolonged use of necrotic forces can drain the psyche into an emotionless husk. Necrotic energy comes from the Shadowfell, the lifeless negative plane that lurks in the darkest depths of the Ethereal Plane, and thus it carries with it the foul spirit of that place. If employed sparingly, necrotic energy is no more than an occasional shadow on one's soul. But those who call often upon this dark force inevitably descend into an emotional abyss, from which it's impossible to escape, even for the strong-willed. This is why necromancers are almost always villains who destroy and terrorise.</p>
<p>Although animated undead aren't intelligent and don't carry any portion of their owner's soul, they do maintain a link to that soul, which enables them to share some of their memories. This is what allows undead to carry out basic tasks without the need for elaborate instructions from their master. Furthermore, when bereft of a master, undead may carry out some routine that they used to perform in life; for example, a guard may patrol a hallway, a potter may endlessly spin a phantom pottery wheel etc.</p>
<p>Being animated by necrotic energy, undead are affected by any biotic energy as if it were corrosive, and they suffer radiant damage. This fact gave rise to the cheapest, and most common, weapon against undead: holy water. Clerics of good deities have rituals that can bless water and infuse it with biotic energy.</p>

<br/><h4>The Paladin Oaths</h4>
<p><i><b>Oath of Devotion.</b> I swear to devote my whole life, body and soul to the service of Law, Order, and Civilization. Henceforth, and until final death claims my soul, my every waking momement, my every breath shall be bound to this sacred duty. My honesty shall light even the most shadowy of deceits. My bravery shall stand fast even before the most trying of horrors. My commitment to Law and to the rightful order shall be unyielding. For I am a Paladin of Bhagavan. I am Truth. I am Courage. I am Law. I am Devotion.</i></p>
<p>The Oath of Devotion is strict and unyielding, and only followers of Bhagavan are rigid enough to swear it. There isn't much room for compassion in this oath, and its paladins are known more as travelling judges than as defenders of the downtrodden.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of the Ancients.</b> I swear to forever serve as a bearer of Light that beats back the Darkness, wherever it might be found. I will kindle the Light in others. I will defend the Light from encroaching Darkness. I will preserve and nourish my own Light, and make it a beacon that brings hope and joy into the most bereavered of hearts.</i></p>
<p>Placing a strong emphasis on compassion and the joy of life, Paladins who swear the Oath of the Ancients are generally the optimistic sort, who travel a lot, aiming to reduce suffering as much as they can. It can be a fairly thankless job, of course, and it is perhaps the Oath that spurs the most disillusionment. Perhaps the most well-known Order that follows this Oath is the Holy Order of Saintly Maria the Humble. These paladins swear an additional oath of poverty, pledging all their earnings to the benefit of the needy.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Vengeance.</b> I swear to never rest until all evil is cleansed from this world. Wherever evil sprouts, I shall strike it down, no matter the cost to myself, and without mercy to those who have committed their lives to evil, for evil must be destroyed. I shall allow no barriers to hold me from delivering just vengeance, for evil must be destroyed. For all the ill that it has wrought, I will find it and smite it, for I am vengeance and evil must be destroyed.</i></p>
<p>Vengeance is arguably not the most noble of paladin oaths, as its adherents are more concerned with the destruction of evil than with the well-being of common beings. If the destruction of a greater evil requires cooperation with a lesser evil, then so be it. If innoncents must die in order to defeat a great villain, then so be it. This is the philosophy of Vengeance: victory at all costs, as the utter destruction of evil is its only goal.</p>
<p>This means that a wide range of characters are attracted to this type of oath, from the chaotic good that want to end evil without recourse to stifling legal process, to the neutral types, that don't so much want to do good, as are interested in the destruction of a particular villain, or group of villains. Many a wronged youth has sworn an Oath of Vengeance in the aftermath of personal tragedy. Needless to say, not all of these quests end well.</p>
<p><i><b>Oath of Order.</b> Good and evil are lies; there is no morality. Life is absurd and knows no distinctions and no fate, save that which we forge ourselves. Order alone can save us from barbarism. Order alone gives meaning to the absurdity of life. I swear to always obey my superior. I swear to always keep my underlings in order. I swear to always uphold the law. I swear to always combat chaos and install order in its place, no matter the cost.</i></p>
<p>The oath of a paladin can be quite burdensome, and not everyone endures this trial without blemish. Those who are at wit's end may renounce their oaths and become Oathbreakers, bereft of their paladin powers. But some aren't content with this state of affairs and they strike a deal with one of the evil Deities, to gain new powers, in exchange for allegiance to the powers of evil. Hel also greatly enjoys seducing noble paladins into Her service, and She will place temptations in the path of those She deems to be wavering in their faith.</p>
<p>There are also rumors of a secret order of Order paladins, who seek to establish a world-wide Empire that perfectly orders all creation. It is unknown what Deity is behind this order, if it exists at all.</p>
<p>The Oath of Power grants a paladin a connection to the necrotic energy of the Shadowfell, providing him with a measure of power over the undead, similar to the Clerics of the domain of death. Why this is so the scholars cannot agree, though it should be mentioned that Undeath has never been the sole purview of Tenebros (most notably, the minor deity Orcus calls himself Prince of Undeath, a title that doesn't sit well with Tenebros).</p>

<br/><h4>The Calendar of Harptos</h4>
<p>Most civilizations of the Frozen Realms now agree on a single calendar, which was first invented by the Wizard-King Harptos, founder of the Mydasian Empire, about a millennia ago. He imposed this calendar on all the regions he conquered, eager to standardize all measures in his new, centralized nation.</p>
<p>Each year has 365 days (corresponding to the time it takes for the planet to revolve around the Sun). There are three months for every season, for a total of 12 months, 30 days each. Five special holidays fall in between the months, marking the passage into a new season. The Shieldsmeet is a special holiday, that is inserted into the calendar every four years to account for leap years.</p><br/>

<br/><h4>The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>Existence is split in a number of enveloping spheres, that can be broadly split into three Realms: Inner, Middle and Outer. The Inner Realm consists of the following spheres (in order): Elemental Sphere, Energetic Sphere and Ethereal Sphere. The Middle Realm consists solely of the Material Sphere. The Outer Realm consists of the following spheres (in order): Astral Sphere, Divine Sphere and Exosphere.</p>
<p>The Elemental Sphere contains the basic building blocks of the world: Earth, Fire, Air and Water. Each element covers a fourth of the sphere and borders all the others. Most of these realms consist of the purest form of the element, but interesting features form at the borders between elements. These borders are generally bearable for mortals and can therefore be safely visited. Elementals inhabit these planes, with some of them organizing themselves into beautiful cities, whose architectural wonders would be impossible in the mortal world. Most famous of these is the efreeti City of Brass, which is completely cosntructed from the eponymous material.</p>

<p>(Conceptual map of the Energetic Sphere superimposed over the Elemental Sphere)</p></center>
<p>The Energetic Sphere is split into two halves: the Feywild and the Shadowfell, one representing life and the other representing death. The Energetic Sphere draws from the raw power of the elements and shapes them into the complex cycle of life and death. This sphere therefore interacts strongly with the one below it, and the Elemental Sphere is visibly affected by the Feywild or Shadowfell in certain places (for example, the desolate Salt Desert is influenced by the Shadowfell).</p>
<p>The Feywild is a verdant and luxuriously lush garden, called home by a vast number of magical plants and creatures. It is the source of the biotic energy that infuses all life and promotes its growth. Biotic energy being so powerful here, there is no patch of land that does not support some form of life. Death is rare and comes only by way of foul magic winds from the Shadowfell. This plane is ruled over by the Fey, who build extensive palaces out of the dense forests. Two Queens hold rival Fey courts, one of Summer and the other of Winter, but their rivalry is less a matter of different morals and more a matter of pride and personal conflict between the two Queens. The Fey who pledge allegiance to the Summer Court are known as Seelie fey, while those who are loyal to the Winter Court are called Unseelie fey. Not all Fey are aligned to one of these courts.</p>
<p>The Shadowfell is the source of death and necrotic energy, so it stands in stark contrast to the Feywild: it is a desolate landscape void of any life. Countless graves litter the plane, even though no one ever lived here to require burial. Restless undead of all kinds scour the place, with no other goal but to prevent any life from intruding upon this place. Unlike the undead of the material plane, these creatures are created from pure necrotic energy alone, and they have no link to a soul that provides memories or purpose.</p>
<p>The Ethereal Sphere is the border between the Middle and Inner Realms and it has no recognizable geography. All we know about it is that it is divided between a Border Ethereal and a Deep Ethereal. The Border Ethereal is like a foggy, slightly distorted version of the material world. The Border Ethereal is easily accessible to a number of magical creatures and spells. It is quite possible to see into it and from it, and to walk into and out of it. Access into the Deep Ethereal is more difficult, and there appears to be nothing of interest here. It is very easy to get lost in the endless fog, permanently shifting colors, that is this plane. With just a bit more effort, however, one can pass through the Ethereal Sphere altogether and reach the Energetic or Elemental Spheres below.</p>

<p>The Divine Sphere is split into 9 different planes, each home to a specific Major Deity, alongside a number of associated Minor Deities. In order, these planes are: the Peaceable Kingdom of Arcadia (LG), the Blessed Fields of Elysium (NG), the Wild Grove of Arborea (CG), the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus (LN), the Infinite Gardens of Mount Celestia (N), the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (CN), the Nine Hells of Baator (LE), the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna (NE) and the Bottomless Abyss (CE). All these planes are tied together by the Infinite Staircase, and they are floating (in a manner of speaking) in the Astral Sphere. Entrances to the staircase litter the Planes, but they are very well hidden and often guarded by powerful creatures. The appearance of the Staircase itself shifts as it traverses the Planes, ranging from nondescript stone masonry, to a jumble of platforms that float in nothingness.</p>
<p>The appearance of each Divine Plane is subject to the whim of its patron Deity, and the chaotic ones often have no permanent form. Furthermore, attempts to open a portal to these planes must have the approval of the patron Deity in order to succeed.</p>
<p>Baator is home to the vast array of Devils, Hel's footsoldiers, led by the tyrannical Asmodeus, who legends say aspires to the throne of Godhood. All the unfortunate souls who go to Baator are transformed into Lemures, wretched wormlike creatures that are doomed to suffer at the hands of the other devils, at least until they are promoted to imps, to serve the Devils. Devils follow a rigid hierarchy, with those that distinguish themselves promoted, while those that disobey or disappoint their leaders getting demoted.</p>
<p>Gehenna is a curious place, home both to the undead and the evil yuggoloths. Most of Gehenna is a rocky wasteland covered in dead and undead, but here and there one can find the hiding places of the yuggoloths where they await, sages say, the call to battle of the Ultimate General, the greatest of the ultroloths.</p>
<p>The Abyss is home to the devils, who are always infinitely many and thoroughly devoted to the destruction of all. The Abyss also boasts infinitely many layers, each with its own leader. Some of them are Minor Deities, and relatively well known for their nefarious schemes, while others remain still unknown. The sages say that the layers are constantly at war with each other, each seeking to impose its dominance over the others, and that this is the only reason while a demonic invasion hasn't yet scoured all life from this world.</p>
<p>The Exosphere is the outermost layer of existence, and it consists of detritus of matter and energy that gradually dissipates into the Void. There are no direct pathways to the Exosphere, and only lost travelers end up here. This is a dangerous place, as it can give way to the lifeless Void without warning, spelling doom for the unwary. The Void beyond contains no life and can support none. Not even spirits tread here, and there are rumors that even magic begins to fizzle and dissipate as it encounters the Void...</p>
<p>Fragments of anicent texts speak of a Far Realm that would lie beyond the Void, or perhaps parallel to existence. It is written that this is a twisted dimension, beholden to rules that are wholly different to those that define our existence. Only madness is to be found in this Far Realm, and if ever a breach is opened to our world, only madness and destruction follows. It is said that desperate or mad warlocks have found ways to make pacts with beings from this dimension, but what, other than horror and madness could be the end of such a pact?</p>
