<h1 align="center">Frozen Realms</h1><br/>
<p>What we call 'Frozen Realms' is known as Neveria to its inhabitants. It is a world immersed in magic, where civilizations rise and fall in a seemingly endless cycle of change. The world is always in some sort of upheaval, and so it is littered with unexplored locations, ancient ruins filled with terrible horrors and tremendous treasure, cosmopolitan cities with wondrous buildings and, of course, plenty of monsters and trouble for brave adventurers to confront.</p>
<p>Neveria has two continents. Devon is by far the largest, and all known civilizations make their home here. Trax is smaller, covered in a hostile jungle, and home only to ruins and devastating monsters and pestilences. It was only recently discovered and little is known about it.</p>

<br/><h4>Deities</h4>
<p>There are 9 major Deities, known and worshiped all throughout the world. Their powers are great thanks to the vast number of their worshipers, which in turn helps them project their power and gain more worshipers. Whenever some great upheaval occurs, you can be near certain a major Deity or another is behind it.</p>
<p>Then there are many more minor Deities, patrons of specific domains or worshiped only by specific cultures (Elven Deities, Dwarven Deities etc). Their power varies with the faith they receive. If they are completely forgotten, they remain little more than above average spirits chained to their former places of worship. They may yet recover their power with new worshipers, or they may fade altogether if the last of their altars is destroyed.</p>
<p>It is said that even Deities can die, although only faint rumors exist on the subject, and even those talk only of forgotten Deities, weakened by a lack of worshipers.</p>
<p>Minor Deities are more likely to answer the pleas of their faithful, not only because there are less of them to manage, but also because it's in their best interest to keep their followers faithful. A minor Deity will quite often walk the Material Plane, interact with worshipers, and even put all of their might behind the needs of a particularly devout follower. Their full might, however powerful by mortal standards, isn't enough, however, to challenge the very fabric of existence, and wherever a major Deity is concerned, a minor one is helpless.<br/>
<p>In contrast, major Deities can do almost anything they put their mind to, but they are far more aloof to their follower's requests. This is part of the reason minor Deities still have a following at all.</p><br/>

</table><br/>
<p>Bhagavan believes in a very strict and unyielding interpretation of what is good. Everything remotely evil must be harshly punished, for law alone is the boundary between good and evil.</p>
<p>Melammu has an altogether more kind view of justice, that seeks to be proportionate with the crime and to encourage rehabilitation. In fact, Melammu often encourages Her adepts to forgive their enemies and help them see the light. She has a daughter, Marianna, Goddess of Rivers and Mercy, whose cult is very firmly centered on pacifism, forgiveness and tolerance of all.</p>
<p>Rigantia beckons Her followers to follow the lure of adventure wherever it might lead. All in need should be aided, no matter the cost and with little regard for consequences. This carefree attitude often places Her followers at odds with those who worship Bhagavan and His strict ways.</p>
<p>Otana is cold and calculated, rarely answering prayers and requests as She likes to let Her followers be challenged; furthermore, albeit ironically, She emphasizes reasoning over faith. When She does speak, it is in riddles and obscure references that challenge the mind.</p>
<p>Darun-Nurad is a two-headed hermaphrodite Deity, who favors ascetic individuals who walk a very narrow path between good and evil. Darun-Nurad enjoys paradoxes, who It believes are the only way to bring one to the ultimate revelation, that good and evil are two sides of the same coin (a doctrine rejected by both good and evil Deities and clergy). It is a reclusive Deity, intervening mostly to ensure that balance between good and evil is maintained. Rarely, It also takes interest in certain individuals, whom It attempts to guide to the 'truth' via odd visions, apparitions, and adventures.</p>
<p>Loki's sole purpose in life is to see laughter (or more often, enjoy a good laugh at the expense of the mortals). Loki will often start a whole chain of improbable events for the sole purpose of constructing a humorous scenario for his enjoyment. One must be very careful when praying to Loki, for He enjoys granting wishes in a twisted way that mock the original intent.</p>
<p>Hel (sometimes also known as the Dark Mistress) is a patron of all who wish to gain and maintain power over others. She loves seducing people into aspiring for greater power, deluding them with dreams of serving their people, obtaining vengeance, or simply being famed throughout history. She loves ambition above all, though all her followers must abide by a strict chain of command, which She insists is the only path to success.</p>
<p>Tenebros (also called Lord of the Night by some cults) is a patron of undead as well as occasional help for those who wish to glimpse into the future or the past. He doesn't care much for evil deeds, but does encourage His followers to blanket the land with death, for it is sweet and dear to Him. Cheating death past one's normal lifespan is anathema to Tenebros, so He will scheme and employ his Divine wrath against such transgressors. The only exception, which only He or foul powers aligned with Him will grant, is undeath, but that comes at the price of eternal servitude.</p>
<p>Ashur is the God of Destruction and War, a force of pure chaos that loves only destruction and is quite likely to turn on His own followers if it provides a better spectacle. Only the mad and the desperate turn to the worship of Ashur, for though He is known for bringing victory in battle, He is also known for His insatiable bloodlust and desire to see the whole world burn. Strangely enough, He sometimes breaks into melancholy and abandons his followers for years, even decades at a time, though He inevitably returns.</p>

<br/><h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The continent of Devon stretches for vast distances and is filled by many wondrous civilizations, as well as countless more ruined civilizations. Only the major Deities are constant in its landscape.</p>
<p>On the north-western coast of Devon stretches the feudal Kingdom of Elamia, founded from the moribound remnants of the once great Mydasian Empire, which covered most of the Western part of the continent until its collapse in the face of repeated invasions by nomads from the East and barbarian tribes from the North. Elamia considers itself as a successor to the legacy of Mydas, although its power is nothing compared to that of the old Empire. Furthermore, it doesn't even hold the old capital of Mydas, once the greatest city in the world, now a ruin haunted by the undead once summoned in its defense.</p>
<p>To the North of Elamia lies the Empire of Perm, which also considers itself a successor to the Mydasian Empire, even though it holds none of the territories once ruled from Mydas. Perm is, however, a very large nation, that grew to encompass all of the barbarian tribes of the North. Its northernmost reaches are sparsely populated and poor, but the climate breeds a hardy people that have earned a fearsome reputation for the Permian army. The southern reaches of the Empire are fertile, and its serfs are tied to their fields, barely better off than slaves. This is a great source of wealth for Perm, who can therefore afford expensive military campaigns to extend its reach.</p>
<p>To the East of Elamia lie hills and mountains rich in ore, home to the Deut Dwarves. Once subservient to the Mydasian Empire, they are now fiercely independent, even to the point of xenophobia. The Deut are fanatical about efficiency and productivity, even by dwarven standards, and they pride themselves on the top notch quality of their products. They've created an impressive network of tunnels between their cities, all in a bid to improve the productivity of their forges, as they send requisite materials by rail to where they're needed. Rumors abound that the Deut are no longer content with their mineral resources and that they're preparing to claim neighboring lands by force.</p>
<p>A particularly tempting target is the Gnomish Confederation of Starmetal Hills. The two races have always colaborated, with great results, but perhaps the hunger for resources might cloud memories of this historic friendship.</p>
<p>South of Elamia, and separated by the Spear Mountains, lies the Elven Kingdom of Celesta, which seems content to isolate itself from the world. Trade with the Kingdom has been in steady decline, and not just because the passes of the Spear Mountains have grown infested with goblinoids.</p>

<br/><h4>The source of magic</h4>
<p>There are three sources of magical energy in Neveria: the Deities, the Weave and the planet itself.</p>
<p>The Deities, having created this world, are the source of Magic, and they can bestow this power upon those who are faithful to them. Clerics and paladins must all dedicate themselves to a specific Deity in order to use magic, and their power is always contingent on the favor of their chosen Deity. It is, however, possible for a cleric or paladin to switch allegiance, although new patrons always test such converts thoroughly. Paladins, however, follow some very strict oaths, and are warriors for a cause. As such, their alignment is limited to LG - Oath of Devotion, NG - Oath of the Ancients, CG - Oath of Vengeance, LE - Oath of Dread. (Neutral alignments don't exactly inspire to a career in their defense; and NE and CE are just thoroughly selfish)</p>
<p>The Weave represents threads of Magic that permeate all planes. It is called thusly because it behaves similarly to a fabric, thicker in some places, torn in others. Threads of the Weave are used when casting, so it is indeed possible to void an area of magic, if only temporarily. There are, however, cursed places where the Weave has been so violently shredded that it shies from entering again (or at least not for many centuries). Antimagic fields can also block the Weave. Wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, bards, eldritch knights and arcane tricksters all use the Weave to power their spells.</p>
<p>Warlocks are a somewhat special case, however, for even though they draw most of their power from the Weave, certain abilities come from their patron, a powerful otherworldly being to which they have pledged their service. These abilities are contingent on maintaining the good graces of the patron, who generally takes poorly to being disobeyed. Possible patrons are: lords or ladies of the fey (CG, N, CN), who like to boast of the mortals in their power, and who sometimes trick people into making such pacts; a powerful fiend, such as an Archdevil, Balor or Ultroloth (in order: LE, CE, NE), who crave power and the enslavement or destruction of the mortal world; Unfathomable Ones, alien beings that are incomprehensible to our minds and who, quite likely, originate from another universe (any chaotic alignment, as well as a fair bit of insanity).</p>
<p>The Unfathomable Ones hold, perhaps, the most tantalizing secrets of all patrons, but their desires generally run counter to the well being of existence, as they wish to enter our dimension and wreak havoc upon it. The Unfathomable Ones are: Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu.</p>
<p>Countless centuries of magic use has saturated the land with magic, so much so, that those who are willing to open themselves up to the world, and view it as a living organism, can gain a little of this power. Unlike the Weave, this power is constant everywhere on the Material Plane. Those who take their power from Nature, however, don't feel at home on the other Planes of existence, and they can't restore any of their powers while there. Druids and Rangers power their magic from the land. This source of magic isn't intrinsically different from the Weave; it's more a matter of personal philosophy. Those who connect with the world in this way lean towards a less strict view of morality, though they also firmly reject evil for personal gain, as well as any action that might harm the natural order. (In other words, CE and NE aren't permitted as alignments, and LE only as a means excuses the end type of personality; if a druid or ranger changes to a forbidden alignment, they automatically lose all of their powers)</p>

<br/><h4>Death</h4>
<p>When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, and goes to abide on the plane that best corresponds to its behavior in life. Following a certain Deity increases one's chances of going to that Deity's Plane. Minor Deities have subdomains in these Planes, where they keep their followers.</p>
<p>Magic makes it possible to bring a soul back from the Astral Plane, although this can only be done with the express approval of the soul, who knows exactly who is trying to bring it back (including alignment and patron deity, if any).</p>
<p>If a body is raised as undead, then that creature can no longer be resurrected. This is why necromancy is generally frowned upon in civilized societies and is, for most intents and purposes, an evil act. In addition, a soul always knows what is happening with its body, and pious creatures may be horrified to know that their bodies are used in such a way.</p>

<br/><h4>The Calendar of Harptos</h4>
<p>Most civilizations of the Frozen Realms now agree on a single calendar, which was first proposed by the wizard Harptos about a millennia ago. Each year of 365 days is divided into 12 months, 30 days each. Five special holidays fall in between the months, marking the passage into a new season. The Shieldmeet is a special holiday, that is inserted into the calendar every four years to account for leap years.</p><br/>

<br/><h4>The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>The Material Plane, the physical world we exist in, lies at the center of a great sphere. Immediately surrounding the world lie the Inner Planes, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane (which also contains the mystical realms of Shadowfell and Feywind). Then come the Outer Planes, linked by the Outlands.</p>
<p>The Inner Planes are home to the raw and untamed elements: Fire, Water, Earth and Air. They form a continuous whole, with interesting features forming at the borders between regions.</p>
<p>Each Outer Plane is home to a specific Major Deity, alongside a number of associated Minor Deities. In order, these planes are: the Peaceable Kingdom of Arcadia (LG), the Blessed Fields of Elysium (NG), the Wild Grove of Arborea (CG), the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus(LN), the Infinite Gardens of Mount Celestia (N), the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (CN), the Nine Hells of Baator (LE), the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna (NE) and the Bottomless Abyss (CE).</p>
<p>The appearance of an Outer Plane is subject to the whim of its patron Deity, and the chaotic ones often have no permanent form. Furthermore, attempts to open a portal to these planes must have the approval of the patron Deity in order to succeed.</p>
<p>All of the Outer Planes are connected by the Infinite Staircase. Entrances to the staircase litter the Planes, but they are very well hidden and often guarded by powerful creatures. The appearance of the Staircase itself shifts as it traverses the Planes, ranging from nondescript stone masonry, to a jumble of platforms that float in nothingness.</p>
<p>Baator is home to the vast array of Devils, Hel's footsoldiers, led by the tyrannical Asmodeus, who legends say aspires to the throne of Godhood. All the unfortunate souls who go to Baator are transformed into Lemures, wretched wormlike creatures that are doomed to suffer at the hands of the other devils, at least until they are promoted to imps, to serve the Devils. Devils follow a rigid hierarchy, with those that distinguish themselves promoted, while those that disobey or disappoint their leaders getting demoted.</p>
<p>Gehenna is a curious place, home both to the undead and the evil yuggoloths. Most of Gehenna is a bleak wasteland covered in dead and undead, but here and there one can find the hiding places of the yuggoloths where they await, sages say, the call to battle of the Ultimate General, the greatest of the ultroloths.</p>
<p>The Abyss is home to the devils, who are always infinitely many and thoroughly devoted to the destruction of all. The Abyss also boasts infinitely many layers, each with its own leader. Some of them are Minor Deities, and relatively well known for their nefarious schemes, while others remain still unknown. The sages say that the layers are constantly at war with each other, each seeking to impose its dominance over the others, and that this is the only reason while a demonic invasion hasn't yet scoured all life from this world...</p>
