<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Paladins are divine warriors, oathbound to a certain set of values which they must always observe and promote, with direct, martial action. Where clerics and priests seek to maintain and promote the cult of their Deity, Paladins fight in the name of their Deity's values. Paladins are therefore largely independent of the religious hierarchy, and they can even maintain some independence from the goals of their Deity so long as the terms of their oath are satisfied. On the other hand, they also lack the powerful connection clerics maintain with their Deity. Paladins cannot directly beseech their Deity for help, and must instead rely on their own powers. This is just as well, for many paladins, however, for they are warriors first and foremost, and they take great pride in their skill at arms. This is their purpose, to launch forth in battle with sacred oaths on their lips.</p>
<p>Another key difference between paladins and clerics lies in their source of power. While clerics must maintain a connection to their Deity and pray daily for their powers, paladins absorb Divine power at their consecration, and they henceforth maintain it by strength of their conviction. Should a paladin lose his commitment to his oath, he will lose all his powers. On the other hand, the patron Deity cannot unilaterally revoke a paladin's powers so long as he remains true to his oath. Therefore, for as long as they are able, paladins fight single-mindedly towards the fulfillment of their oath. While this doesn't necessarily mean that they will rush heedlessly into peril, or that they will never bend the rules, it does mean that a Paladin cannot ignore a call to action.</p>
<p>Paladins are, by nature, adventurers, travelling far and wide in order to seek out enemies and destroy them, or to protect the faithful. Most paladins are Good, and fight for justice and order, protecting the innocent and casting down the villainous. However, Evil Deities can inspire a similar dedication in their warriors, who fight to gather power and cement a new world order. Only the Neutral Deities have failed to inspire any order of paladins, their ambiguous stance on morality a poor inspiration for the sternly worded paladin vows.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d10, so your starting hp is 10 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d10 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> All armor and shields, simple and martial weapons. Intuition and Charisma defenses. Skills: Will and two choices from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Force, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a martial weapon and a shield or two martial weapons, five javelins or any simple melee weapon; chain mail and a holy symbol; light crossbow and 20 bolts or a simple weapon; a holy symbol and a shield; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a priest's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Divine Sense</h4>
<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears (or the other way around if you are devoted to an evil Deity). As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 12 squares (18m) of you. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, such as with the <i>hallow</i> spell.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + CHA (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
<h4>Lay on Hands</h4>
<p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hp to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hp from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hp separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>
<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
<p>You adopt a particular style of combat as your specialty. Provided you get a second choice you cannot choose the same style again.</p>
<p><b><i>Defense.</i></b> While you are wearing armor, gain +1 to AC.</p>
<p><b><i>Dueling.</i></b> When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and the other is free, gain +2 to damage with that weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Great Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a two-handed or versatile weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>
<p><b><i>Protection.</i></b> When a creature attacks an ally next to you, you can impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided you hold a shield.</p>
<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> At the end of a long rest, you meditate on your mission and prepare CHA + half your paladin level (rounded down, minimum of one) paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h4>Divine Smite</h4>
<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal force damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a celestial, undead or a fiend.</p>
<h4>Divine Health</h4>
<p>The divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make a second attack.</p>
<h4>Aura of Protection</h4>
<p>All friendly creatures within 2 squares of you, including yourself, gain a bonus to all their defenses except AC equal to your CHA (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 6 squares.</p>
<p>At 21st level, the aura also confers a +1 bonus to AC to friendly creatures in range.</p>
<h4>Aura of Courage</h4>
<p>You and friendly creatures within 2 squares of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 6 squares.</p>
<h4>Improved Divine Smite</h4>
<p>You are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.</p>
<h4>Cleansing Touch</h4>
<p>You can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to CHA (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Improved Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>You can now use channel divinity twice per short or long rest.</p>

<br/><h3>Sacred Oaths</h3>
<p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that tightly bind him to a specific set of values. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the final culmination of all the years of training and of proven bravery in the field. Most characters of this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is just a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>
<br/><h4>Oath of Devotion</h4>
<p>The Oath of Devotion is for the Lawful Good, those who want to press their whole being in service to the greater good, to uphold the laws and norms of the society and Deity of their choice. This is the strictest oath a paladin can swear, requiring unswerving commitment to the cause of Good, with little wiggle room for personal freedom or moral ambiguity. They hold angels - the perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>
<p><b><i>Oath Spells.</i></b> Oath spells are always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>3rd level: <i>protection from evil and good, sanctuary</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>lesser restoration, zone of truth</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>beacon of hope, dispel magic</i></p>
<p>13th level: <i>freedom of movement, guardian of faith</i></p>
<p>17th level: <i>commune, flame strike</i></p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You choose which of the following options to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
<p><u>Sacred Weapon.</u> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 rounds, you add CHA to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 4-square radius and dim light 4 squares beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
<p><u>Turn the Unholy.</u> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead. Roll Will vs INT against every fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you. On success, the creature is turned for 10 turns or until it takes damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape fram an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
<p><b><i>Aura of Devotion.</i></b> Gained at level 7. You and friendly creatures within 2 squares of you can't be charmed while you are conscious.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Purity of Spirit.</i></b> Gained at level 15. You are always under the effects of a <a href="../spells/protection.html">protection from evil and good</a> spell. These effects cannot be dispelled.</p>
<p><b><i>Holy Nimbus.</i></b> Gained at level 20. As an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 10 rounds, bright light shines from you in a 6-square radius, and dim light shines 6 squares beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, the spells that fiends or undead cast against you have disadvantage on rolls that target non-AC defenses. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<br/><h4>Oath of the Ancients</h4>
<p>Paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in the abstract principles of the day. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things, leaves, antlers, or flowers, to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Oath Spells.</i></b> Oath spells are always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>3rd level: <i>ensnaring strike, speak with animals</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>moonbeam, misty step</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>plant growth, protection from energy</i></p>
<p>13th level: <i>ice storm, stoneskin</i></p>
<p>17th level: <i>commune with nature, tree stride</i></p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You choose which of the following options to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
<p><u>Nature's Wrath.</u> As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 2 squares of you that you can see. Roll Will vs STR/DEX (whichever is higher) to <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrain</a> the creature. At the end of each of your turns, you must successfully repeat the roll, or the vines vanish and the creature is no longer restrained.</p>
<p><u>Turn the Faithless.</u> As an action, you present your holy symbol. Roll Will vs INT against every fiend or fey that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you. On success, the creature is turned for 10 turns or until it takes damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape fram an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>
<p><b><i>Aura of Warding.</i></b> Gained at level 7. Ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 2 squares of you have resistance to damage from spells.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Undying Sentinel.</i></b> Gained at level 15. When you are reduced to 0 hp and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hp instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.</p>
<p><b><i>Elder Champion.</i></b> Gained at level 20. Once per long rest, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 10 rounds, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hp.</li>
  <li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>
  <li>Gain advantage on Paladin spell and Channel Divinity attack rolls against enemies within 2 squares of you.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h4>Oath of Vengeance</h4>
<p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside; at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins, sometimes called avengers or dark knights, their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p>
<p><b><i>Oath Spells.</i></b> Oath spells are always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>3rd level: <i>bane, hunter's mark</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>hold person, misty step</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>haste, protection from energy</i></p>
<p>13th level: <i>banishment, dimension door</i></p>
<p>17th level: <i>hold monster, scrying</i></p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You choose which of the following options to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
<p><u>Abjure Enemy.</u> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation. Roll Will vs INT against one creature within 12 squares of you that you can see. You have advantage against fiends or undead. Creatures immune to fear are immune to this effect.</p>
<p>On success, the creature is <a href="../conditions/frightened.html">frightened</a> for 10 rounds or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. On failure, the creature's speed is halved for 10 rounds or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p><u>Vow of Emnity.</u> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 2 squares of you. You gain advantage on rolls against creature's AC for 10 rounds.</p>
<p><b><i>Relentless Avenger.</i></b> Gained at level 7. Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><b><i>Soul of Vengeance.</i></b> Gained at level 15. The authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>
<p><b><i>Angel of Vegeance.</i></b> Gained at level 20. Once per long rest, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 12 squares.</li>
  <li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 6-square radius. Any enemy in the aura or who enters the aura who isn't immune to fear can be frightened by you. Roll Will vs INT. On success, the enemy becomes frightened of you for 10 rounds or until it takes any damage. Attacks against the frightened creature's AC have advantage.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h4>Oath of Order</h4>
<p>The Oath of Order is Lawful Evil, and it aims at the inregimentation of all mortals into a stable, ordered society; purely for the greater good, of course. The paladins who walk these path are not shy of seizing and wielding power in order to further their goals. They have great respect for authority and hierarchy, and will always seek to impose one where there is none. Although lacking in scruples, this path is no less rigid or demanding than the other oaths; paladins of order fight tirelessly to impose the rule of law wherever they tread.</p>
<p><b><i>Oath Spells.</i></b> Oath spells are always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>3rd level: <i>hellish rebuke, inflict wounds</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>crown of madness, darkness</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>animate dead, bestow curse</i></p>
<p>13th level: <i>blight, confusion</i></p>
<p>17th level: <i>contagion, dominate person</i></p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You choose which of the following options to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
<p><u>Control Undead.</u> As an action, you roll Will vs INT against an undead creature you can see within 12 squares. On success, the target must obey your commands for 24 hours, or until you use this option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal or higher than your paladin level is immune.</p>
<p><u>Dreadful Aspect.</u> As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. For 10 turns, the paladin can roll Will vs INT against every creature within 6 squares that can see him. On success, the target is frightened of the paladin until the end of its turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Aura of Hate.</i></b> Gained at level 7. The paladin and all friendly creatures within 2 squares of the paladin gain a bonus to melee damage equal to the paladin's CHA (minimum of +1). Auras from several dark paladins do not overlap.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Supernatural Resilience.</i></b> Gained at level 15. Gain resistance to piercing, slashing and crushing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Dread Lord.</i></b> Gained at level 20. Once per long rest, you can use an action to surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 10 rounds. The aura reduces any bright light in a 6 square radius around you to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, you and creatures of your choosing in the aura are draped in deep shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attacks vs AC against creatures draped in this shadow.</p>
<p>While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature inside it, Will vs AC, 3d10 + CHA necrotic damage on hit.</p>
