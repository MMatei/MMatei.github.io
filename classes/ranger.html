<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers are dedicated monster hunters that defend the edges of civilization from the rampaging threats that might overwhelm it: humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
<p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
<p>They do not have the rigidity of druids in regard to civilization, instead favoring the middle path. This makes them less able to harness the power of nature, but they compensate with steel and grit.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d10, so your starting hp is 10 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d10 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields, simple and martial weapons. Strength and Dexterity defenses. Skills: Attunement and one choice from Animal Handling, Athletics, Craft, Escape Artist, Insight, Linguistics, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a longbow and 20 arrows, two shortswords or two simple melee weapons; scale mail, or leather armor; light crossbow and 20 bolts or a simple weapon; a druidic focus and a shield; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Favored Enemy</h4>
<p>You have dedicated your life thus far studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. They are at once the nemesis you have sworn to exterminate and your specialty. Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead.</p>
<p>You gain +2 to damage rolls against creatures of the chosen type. You also have advantage on Survival checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Memory checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>
<h4>Natural Explorer</h4>
<p>You are particularly familiar with living and fighting in the great outdoors. You gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You ignore difficult terrain, and it doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
  <li>Gain advantage on navigation checks; if you already have advantage by other means, then you cannot get lost, except by magical means.</li>
  <li>If you are traveling alone, you can move at a normal pace while gaining the benefits of a slow pace.</li>
  <li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
  <li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
<p>You adopt a particular style of combat as your specialty. Provided you get a second choice you cannot choose the same style again.</p>
<p><b><i>Archery.</i></b> Gain +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Defense.</i></b> While you are wearing armor, gain +1 to AC.</p>
<p><b><i>Dueling.</i></b> When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and the other is free, gain +2 to damage with that weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Two Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When fighting with two weapons, you can add your damage modifier to the second attack.</p>
<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
<p>The class progression table shows how many spell slots you have and how many spells you know, at every level. When you learn new spells, you select them from the ranger spell list. They must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, every time you gain a level, you may replace one ranger spell with another ranger spell of your choice.</p>
<h4>Primeval Awareness</h4>
<p>You can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1km of you (or within up to 10km if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. You get a pretty good estimate of their location and number, but nothing exact.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make a second attack.</p>
<h4>Greater Favored Enemy</h4>
<p>You are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.</p>
<p>Additionally your greater favored enemies have disadvantage on rolls made for spells and special abilities they use against you.</p>
<h4>Natural Healing</h4>
<p>Your time in the wilderness has hardened your body, so that you can recover from injury easier than most. When spending Hit Dice to heal yourself, if you roll a 1 you can roll again, but must use the new result.</p>
<h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
<p>You can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree, a wall, or the ground, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4>Vanish</h4>
<p>You can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>
<h4>Feral Senses</h4>
<p>You gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 6 squares of you, provided that you know of its existence and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p>
<h4>Foe Slayer</h4>
<p>You become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your INT to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before the effects of the roll are resolved.</p>
<h4>Deadly Aim</h4>
<p>By aiming for an enemy's soft spot, you aim to kill it outright. When you attack with a weapon, you can choose to roll with disadvantage, but if the hit connects then it is an automatic critical, and the resulting damage is doubled.</p>

<br/><h3>Ranger Archetypes</h3>
<h4>Hunter</h4>
<p>You are the bulwark between civilization and the horrors of the wilderness, the ultimate monster slayer. As you walk the hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.</p>
<p><b><i>Hunter's Prey.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You gain one of the following features of your choice:</p>
<p>Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. The extra damage becomes 2d8 at 14th level.</p>
<p>Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 1 square of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</p>
<p>Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 1 square of the original target and within range of your weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Defensive Tactics.</i></b> Gained at level 7. You gain one of the following features of your choice:</p>
<p>Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>

<p>Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 1 square of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.</p>
<p><b><i>Superior Hunter's Defense.</i></b> Gained at level 15. You gain one of the following features of your choice:</p>
<p>Evasion. You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that attacks your Dexterity whose failure would still deal half damage, then you take half damage if it succeeeds, and no damage if it fails.</p>
<p>Deflect Blow. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.</p>
<p>Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>
<p><b><i>Expose Weakness.</i></b> Gained at level 21. You use a skillful attack to open a chink in the enemy's armor that your companions might exploit. When you land a hit on a creature, you can choose to lower its AC by 2 for the rest of the battle, instead of applying damage. You cannot stack this condition on a creature.</p>

<br/><h4>Beast Master</h4>
<p>You embody a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.</p>
<p><b><i>Ranger's Companion.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its max hp equals four times your ranger level.</p>
<p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</p>
<p>While traveling with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</p>
<p><b><i>Exceptional Training.</i></b> Gained at level 7. On any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.</p>

<p><b><i>War Beast.</i></b> Gained at level 21. Your beast's max hp is now five times your ranger level, and you add your INT to its damage rolls.</p>
