<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the Deities gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>
<p>They wield not the rigid shapes and phrases of the Wizards, but the deeper harmonies of the Universe, which they influence with the power of their song and of their will. It can therefore be said that Bards sit somewhere in the middle between Wizards and Sorcerers, their power neither fully drawn from the inside, nor fully drawn from the outside.</p>
<p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>
<p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d8 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light armor, simple weapons, crossbows, longswords, rapiers. Dexterity and Charisma defenses. Skills: Will and any two other of your choice.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a rapier or a longsword or a simple weapon; any musical instrument; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a diplomat's pack or an entertainer's pack</a>; leather armor and a dagger.</p>
<p><b><i>Known Spells.</i></b> The class progression table shows how many cantrips and spells you know. You choose new spells to learn from the Bard list of spells (you can only learn spells of a level you can cast). Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you already know with any other Bard spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual.</p>
<h4>Bardic Inspiration</h4>
<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 12 squares of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die (see class progression table for the die type).</p>
<p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one d20 roll it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide hefore the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Jack of All Trades</h4>
<p>You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p>
<h4>Song of Rest</h4>
<p>You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hp at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hp (the amount increases to 1d8 at level 9, 1d10 at level 13 and 1d12 at level 17).</p>
<h4>Expertise</h4>
<p>Choose two of your skill proficiencies, except Will. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1 or choose a <a href="../rules.html#feats">feat</a>. Once you achieve level 20, ability scores over +5.</p>
<h4>Font of Inspiration</h4>
<p>You regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4>Countercharm</h4>
<p>You gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, attacks that seek to frighten or charm you or any friendly creature within 6 squares of you that can hear you are rolled with disadvantage. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>
<h4>Magical Secrets</h4>
<p>You have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number of overall spells known.</p>
<h4>Superior Inspiration</h4>
<p>When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>

<br/><h3>Bard College</h3>
<p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p>
<br/><h4>College of Lore</h4>
<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>
<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a Deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>
<p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>
<p><b><i>Bonus Proficiencies.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You gain proficiency with two skills of your choice.</p>
<p><b><i>Cutting Words.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 12 squares of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</p>
<p><b><i>Additional Magical Secrets.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>
<p><b><i>Peerless Skill.</i></b> Gained at level 14. When you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells rou whether you succeed or fail.</p>

<br/><h4>College of Valor</h4>
<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>
<p><b><i>Bonus Proficiencies.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Combat Inspiration.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p>
<p><b><i>Extra Attack.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Battle Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
