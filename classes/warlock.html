<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Warlocks are people of insatiable curiosity, for whom no knowledge can classify as forbidden, or too terrible or too dangerous to be known. They want to know all that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, to unravel all the mysteries of existence and of the Weave. However warlocks disdain the academic process of the wizarding schools; they wish to discover and understand, not memorise countless small details that they see as irrelevant to the bigger picture. Impatient to delve into the mysteries of the universe and convinced that no price is too high for knowing, warlocks strike deals with mysterious beings of supernatural power, which grant them powers equivalent to those of wizards. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, and even powerful outsiders from the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>
<p>Warlocks are defined by a pact with an otherworldy patron, a powerful being willing and able to impart some of its power, and some of its secrets, with a mortal. The relationship between a warlock and its patron is somewhat like that between an apprentice and its master, but also similar to the relation between a Deity and a Paladin. The patron alters the very being of the warlock, changing him to be slightly more like the patron, and thus able to easily access the Weave in a way mortal wizards can only dream of. The patron also shares some arcane secrets, enabling a warlock to tap into unique and interesting powers. In exchange, however, the warlock must perform some deeds for his/her patron. This relationship can be quite loose, and patrons are generally disinterested in what the warlock chooses to do with the gained powers, so long as the patron gains some profit by it. A warlock certainly need not share the goals or values of their patron, and might simply see this as the only path to the secrets they so crave.</p>
<p>Driven to know, the warlocks are eager adventurers, willing to delve into the thickest trouble, for they know that that's where knowledge and power is to be found. Always expecting trouble, they are comfortable with hand to hand fighting and light armor, and are quite willing to get their hands dirty, unlike the bookish wizards.</p>
<p>Warlocks generally hide their true identity, posing as wizards or even sorcerers, or even hiding their magic altogether if they can get away with it. This is because they are well aware of the fear and hatred they inspire in the general populace - the entities they deal with are not exactly welcome in most societies! Warlocks are also shunned by other magic users, for they can bring trouble on an otherwise quiet magical community - many a pogrom was started by an angry mob looking to lynch a warlock.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + Constitution. For each new level, gain 1d8 + Constitution.</p>

<h4>Pact Magic</h4>
<p><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You know 2 cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the class progression table.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have, and of what level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Eldritch Master</h4>
<p>You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots. You can beseech your patron while moving, but can't take any other actions save Disengage and Dodge. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>

<h4>Eldritch Invocations</h4>
<p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, that provide you with magic unlike that wielded by more conventional magicians. See the class progression table for the number of invocations you know. When you gain a level, you can replace one of the invocations you know with any other you could learn at that level.</p>
<p><b><i>Agonizing Blast.</i></b> Prerequisite: <i>eldritch blast</i> cantrip. When you cast <i>eldritch blast</i>, add your Charisma to the damage it deals on hit.</p>
<p><b><i>Armor of Shadows.</i></b> You can cast <i>magic armor</i> on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>

<p><b><i>Book of Ancient Secrets.</i></b> Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome. You can now inscribe magical rituais in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag fram any c1ass's spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals (and only rituals, unless you learn them by conventional means). You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p>
<p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
<p><b><i>Chains of Carceri.</i></b> Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain. You can cast <i>hold monster</i> on a celestial, fiend or elemental at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. You can't use this feature again on the same monster until you finish a long rest.</p>

<p><b><i>Gaze of Two Minds.</i></b> You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, as well as your own, but you are blinded and deafened to your body's surroundings.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifedrinker.</i></b> Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade. When you hit an enemy with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your CHA (minimum of 1).</p>
<p><b><i>Mask of Many Faces.</i></b> You can cast <i>disguise self</i> at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>

<p><b><i>Sculptor of Flesh.</i></b> Prerequisite: 7th level. You can cast <i>polymorph</i> once per long rest, using a warlock spell slot.</p>
<p><b><i>Sign of Ill Omen.</i></b> Prerequisite: 5th level. You can cast <i>bestow curse</i> using a warlock spell slot. The spell doesn't count as one of your known spells and cannot be swapped for another on gaining a level.</p>
<p><b><i>Thief of Five Fates.</i></b> You can cast <i>bane</i> using a warlock spell slot. The spell doesn't count as one of your known spells and cannot be swapped for another on gaining a level.</p>

<br/><h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3>
<p>Any supernatural being of immense power (by mortal standards) can serve as a patron, if it is willing to make such a deal (it can conceivably be forced into a deal, but a most exhaustive set of circumstances would be required). But the most common patrons are an archfey, a powerful fiend, or an Unfathomable One.</p>
<br/><h4>Pact Boon</h4>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Chain.</i></b> You learn the <i>find familiar</i> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to instruct your familiar to make one attack of its own. Your familiar is also more cunning than usual, and can be successfully tasked with more complex actions. The familiar bears a measure of connection with your patron, who can speak through the familiar (if it elects such a method of communication). The appearance of the familiar will bear some marks of your patron.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: your familiar's attributes are increased by 2 each, and its AC increases by 1.</p>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Blade.</i></b> You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your hands. It can take any form you choose, and it will have the properties of that particular weapon type. It is considered a magic weapon, however. You are always proficient with the pact weapon.</p>
<p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 1 square away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
<p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: your pact weapon does an additional die of necrotic damage, and you can force artifacts and sentent weapons to your will; your ritual can now transform such a weapon into a pact weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Tome.</i></b> Your patron gives you a finely crafted grimoire bearing their mark, called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
<p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: until a long rest, for a number of times equal to your Charisma (minimum of 1), you can cast a cantrip in the Book of Shadows twice in the same action.</p>

<br/><h4>Archfey</h4>
<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, who was old when the mortals races were barely learning to stand upright. Their motives are varied, sometimes whimsical, and their alignment leans towards Chaotic, whether selfless or selfish. Some fey enjoy beguiling mortals, others may genuinely fall in love, others still may have a grudge that needs to be settled.</p>
<p><b><i>Expanded Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>faerie fire, sleep</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>calm emotions, phantasmal force</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>blink, plant growth</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>dominate beast, greater invisibility</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>dominate person, seeming</i></p>
<p><b><i>Fey Presence.</i></b> Gained at level 1. As an action, you can roll spellpower vs Warding against every creature in a 2 square cube originating from you. On hit, a creature is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Misty Escape.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to vanish in a puff of mist, becoming invisible and teleporting up to 12 squares to any space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Beguiling Defenses.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You learn how to turn mind affecting magic against your enemies. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. Roll spellpower vs Charisma in order to charm your opponent for 10 rounds or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dark Delirium.</i></b> Gained at level 14. As an action, roll spellpower vs Warding against a creature that you can see within 12 squares of you. On hit, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 10 rounds or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
<p><b><i>Fey Magick.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Spells from fey spell list (noted in the expanded spell list entry) are cast as if using a 9th level spell slot.</p>

<br/><h4>Greater Fiend</h4>
<p>Powerful denizens of the outer realms of evil have reasons aplenty to collaborate with mortals, though they are all nefarious. Possible patrons are Archdevils, Ultroloths, Balors, or even Demon Lords, should one be so bold.</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>burning hands, command</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>blindness/deafness, scorching ray</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>fireball, stinking cloud</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>fire shield, wall of fire</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>flame strike, hallow</i></p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Blessing.</i></b> Gained at level 1. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, you gain temporary hp equal to your Charisma + your warlock level (minimum of 1).</p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Luck.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Once per short/long rest, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make a roll, you can use this feature to add a d10 to it. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.</p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Resilience.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
<p><b><i>Hurl through Hell.</i></b> Gained at level 14. Once per long rest, you can teleport a creature to the abyssal domain of your patron, where it witnesses a most nightmarish visage. At the end of your next turn, the creature returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest available space. If the target isn't a fiend, it suffers 10d10 psychic damage from the horrible experience.</p>
<p><b><i>Avatar of the Fiend.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Desperate to win the battle, you give yourself over to your patron, who takes over your body, which mutates horribly to accomodate the fiend. You gain your max hp as temporary hp and your melee attacks deal an extra 3d6 fire damage, however you are barely in control of your actions. In this state, the fiend can direct your body as it sees fit, which it may use in order to fulfill its own goals (or just to rampage wantonly). In order to regain control, you must pass a DC 26 Will check, which can only be repeated once every minute. Once you regain control, your body returns to normal.</p>

<br/><h4>Unfathomable One</h4>
<p>Unfathomable Ones are utterly alien beings from the mysterious Far Realm. Their reasoning and goals are incomprehensible to our minds and they don't seem to have any concept of morality. They do have, however, perhaps the most tantalizing secrets of all patrons, but their desires generally run counter to the well being of existence, as they wish to enter our dimension and wreak havoc upon it. Even merely making contact with an Unfathomable One is a highly risky proposition that is likely to end in disaster not only for the supplicant, but also for much of the world around him.</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>dissonant whispers, hideous laughter</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>detect thoughts, phantasmal force</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>bestow curse, clairvoyance</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>dominate beast, dark tentacles</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>dominate person, telekinesis</i></p>
<p><b><i>Awakened Mind.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 6 squares of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p>
<p><b><i>Entropic Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself, When a creature makes an attack roll vs AC against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll vs AC against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. You can only use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Thought Shield.</i></b> Gained at level 10. Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>
<p><b><i>Create Thrall.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>Shatter Minds.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained glimpses into the madness of this universe, enough that you can now irrevocably shatter the minds of those you enthrall. When you create a thrall, the creature is now under your complete control, and the damage can only be undone with a <i>wish</i> spell. Furthermore, you can control two thralls at the same time.</p>
