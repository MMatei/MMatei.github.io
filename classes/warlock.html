<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>
<p>Warlocks are defined by a pact with an otherworldy patron, a powerful being willing and able to impart some of its power, and some of its secrets, with a mortal. The relationship between a warlock and its patron is somewhat like that between an apprentice and its master. The patron lends some powers to the warlock, as well as arcane teachings, but unlike a cleric, a warlock draws most of its power on its own, from the Weave. This in turn means that the realtionship between warlock and patron is more flexible than that between cleric and Deity. A warlock need not share the goals or values of their patron, and might simply see this as the only path to the secrets they so crave. The patron will, of course, expect some services in turn, but exactly what these are and how the relationship works depend on the patron.</p>
<p>Warlocks are generally obsessed with secrets, for why make such a perilous pact in the first place, if not to find knowledge that cannot be acquired elsewhere? They would like to understand the deepest intricacies of the universe, and in their hunger for answers, there is no such thing as forbidden lore. Unlike wizards, warlocks are driven to understand, even if the answer will only drive them mad.</p>
<p>Further unlike the bookish wizards, warlocks are a more adventurous type, willing to delve into the thickest trouble, for they know that that's where knowledge is to be found. They are comfortable with hand to hand fighting and light armor, and are quite willing to get their hands dirty.</p>

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, as well as your own, but you are blinded and deafened to your body's surroundings.</p>
<p><b><i>Lifedrinker.</i></b> Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade. When you hit an enemy with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Cha modifier (minimum of 1).</p>

<br/><h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3>
<p>Any supernatural being of immense power (by mortal standards) can serve as a patron, if it is willing to make such a deal (it can conceivably be forced into a deal, but a most exhaustive set of circumstances would be required). But the most common patrons are an archfey, a powerful fiend, or an Unfathomable One.</p>
<br/><h4>Pact Boon</h4>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Chain.</i></b> You learn the <i>find familiar</i> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to instruct your familiar to make one attack of its own. Your familiar is also more cunning than usual, and can be successfully tasked with more complex actions. The familiar bears a measure of connection with your patron, who can speak through the familiar (if it elects such a method of communication). The appearance of the familiar will bear some marks of your patron.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: your familiar's attributes are increased by 2 each, and its AC increases by 1.</p>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Blade.</i></b> You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your hands. It can take any form you choose, and it will have the properties of that particular weapon type. It is considered a magic weapon, however. You are always proficient with the pact weapon.</p>
<p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 1 square away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
<p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1 hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: your pact weapon does an additional die of necrotic damage, and you can force artifacts and sentent weapons to your will; your ritual can now transform such a weapon into a pact weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Pact of the Tome.</i></b> Your patron gives you a finely crafted grimoire bearing their mark, called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.</p>
<p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1 hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>
<p>At level 21, the boon is empowered: until a long rest, for a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), you can cast a cantrip in the Book of Shadows twice in the same action.</p>

<br/><h4>Archfey</h4>
<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, who was old when the mortals races were barely learning to stand upright. Their motives are varied, sometimes whimsical, and their alignment lies in the Chaotic Good - Chaotic Neutral range. Some fey enjoy beguiling mortals, others may genuinely fall in love, others still may have a grudge that needs to be settled.</p>
<p><b><i>Expanded Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>faerie fire, sleep</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>calm emotions, phantasmal force</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>blink, plant growth</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>dominate beast, greater invisibility</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>dominate person, seeming</i></p>
<p><b><i>Fey Presence.</i></b> Gained at level 1. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 2 square cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Misty Escape.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to vanish in a puff of mist, becoming invisible and teleporting up to 12 squares to any space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Beguiling Defenses.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You learn how to turn mind affecting magic against your enemies. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dark Delirium.</i></b> Gained at level 14. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 12 squares of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC, or it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 10 rounds or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
<p><b><i>Fey Magick.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Spells from fey spell list (noted in the expanded spell list entry) are cast as if using a 9th level spell slot.</p>

<br/><h4>Greater Fiend</h4>
<p>Powerful denizens of the outer realms of evil have reasons aplenty to collaborate with mortals, though they all are nefarious. Possible patrons are Archdevils (LE), Ultroloths (NE), or Balors (CE).</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>burning hands, command</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>blindness/deafness, scorching ray</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>fireball, stinking cloud</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>fire shield, wall of fire</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>flame strike, hallow</i></p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Blessing.</i></b> Gained at level 1. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, you gain temporary hp equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).</p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Luck.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Once per short/long rest, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d1O to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.</p>
<p><b><i>Fiendish Resilience.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
<p><b><i>Hurl through Hell.</i></b> Gained at level 14. Once per long rest, you can teleport a creature to the abyssal domain of your patron, where it witnesses a most nightmarish visage. At the end of your next turn, the creature returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest available space. If the target isn't a fiend, it suffers 10d10 psychic damage from the horrible experience.</p>
<p><b><i>Avatar of the Fiend.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Desperate to win the battle, you give yourself over to your patron, who takes over your body, which mutates horribly to accomodate the fiend. You gain your max hp as temporary hp and your melee attacks deal an extra 3d6 fire damage, however you are barely in control of your actions. In this state, the fiend can direct your body as it sees fit, which it may use in order to fulfill its own goals (or just to rampage wantonly). In order to regain control, you must pass a DC 26 Cha check, which can only be repeated once every minute. Once you regain control, your body returns to normal.</p>

<br/><h4>Unfathomable One</h4>
<p>Unfathomable Ones are alien beings that are incomprehensible to our minds and who, quite likely, originate from another universe (alignment holds no meaning for these alien beings). They hold, perhaps, the most tantalizing secrets of all patrons, but their desires generally run counter to the well being of existence, as they wish to enter our dimension and wreak havoc upon it. The Unfathomable Ones are: Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu.</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell List.</i></b> Your patron offers an extended list of spells to the warlock's normal selection.</p>
<p>1st level: <i>dissonant whispers, hideous laughter</i></p>
<p>2nd level: <i>detect thoughts, phantasmal force</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>clairvoyance, sending</i></p>
<p>4th level: <i>dominate beast, dark tentacles</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>dominate person, telekinesis</i></p>
<p><b><i>Awakened Mind.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 6 squares of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p>
<p><b><i>Entropic Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself, When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. You can only use this feature once per short/long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Thought Shield.</i></b> Gained at level 10. Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>
<p><b><i>Create Thrall.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a <i>remove curse</i> spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>Shatter Minds.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained glimpses into the madness of this universe, enough that you can now irrevocably shatter the minds of those you enthrall. When you create a thrall, the creature is now under your complete control, and the damage can only be undone with a <i>wish</i> spell. Furthermore, you can control two thralls at the same time.</p>
