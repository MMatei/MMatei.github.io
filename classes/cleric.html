<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>
<p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p>
<p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d8 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields, all simple weapons. Saving throws: Wis, Cha. Skills: choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a mace or (if proficient) a warhammer; scale mail, or leather armor or (if proficient) chain mail; light crossbow and 20 bolts or a simple weapon; a holy symbol and a shield; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a priest's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> At the end of a long rest, you prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric levei (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since your power comes from intense devotion to your Deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Most importantly, the save DC for your spells is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wis modifier, and the attack modifier for spells is proficiency bonus + Wis modifier.</p>
<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You can use Channel Divinity for a number of times and must then finish a short or long rest. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws whose DC equals your c1eric spell save DC.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>

<br/><h3>Divine Domain</h3>
<h4>Knowledge Domain</h4>
<p>Deities with a portfolio in knowledge have many different views. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can.</p>
