<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>
<p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p>
<p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d8 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields, all simple weapons. Saving throws: Wis, Cha. Skills: choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a mace or (if proficient) a warhammer; scale mail, or leather armor or (if proficient) chain mail; light crossbow and 20 bolts or a simple weapon; a holy symbol and a shield; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a priest's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> At the end of a long rest, you prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell  prepared.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since your power comes from intense devotion to your Deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Most importantly, the save DC for your spells is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wis modifier, and the attack modifier for spells is proficiency bonus + Wis modifier.</p>
<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You can use Channel Divinity for a number of times and must then finish a short or long rest. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws whose DC equals your c1eric spell save DC.</p>
<p><b><i>Turn Undead.</i></b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you must make a Wisdom save or be turned for 10 rounds or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Destroy Undead</h4>
<p>When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, which you can find on the features column of the Class Progression Table.</p>
<h4>Divine Intervention</h4>
<p>You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>

<br/><h3>Divine Domain</h3>
<p>Although they may wish to appear so, Deities aren't all powerful, and Their purview is limited to one or more Divine Domains. Clerics can therefore only choose a Domain over which their chosen Deity has power.</p>
<p>Each domain has a list of spells that you gain at the c1eric levels noted in the description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

<br/><h4>Death Domain</h4>
<p>The Death domain is concerned only with the necrotic energy emanating from the Shadowfell. It deals in death and undeath, and so its practitioners generally become thoroughly corrupted by necrotic energy, to the point where they are little more than merciless avatars of Death.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>false life, ray of sickness</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>animated dead, vampiric touch</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>blight, death ward</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>antilife shell, cloudkill</i></p>
<p><b><i>Reaper.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You gain proficiency with martial weapons and you learn one necromancy cantrip from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip or level 1 spell that normally targets one creature, you can instead target two creatures within range, standing within 1 square of each other.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Touch of Death.</i></b> Gained at level 2. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use channel divinity to deal an extra 5 + twice your cleric level necrotic damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Inescapable Destruction.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You ignore resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Death Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Command Undead.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can use magic to bring undead under your control, regardless of the power that created them. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 12 squares (18m) of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p>
<p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</p>
<p><b><i>Lord of the Undead.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Ignore the time limit for maintaining control of undead for a number of the weakest (by CR, ties broken by player) under your command, up to a maximum equal to your Intuition modifier (a minimum of 1). Intelligent undead under your command can keep making their saves regardless of this feature.</p>

<br/><h4>Knowledge Domain</h4>
<p>Deities with a portfolio in knowledge have many different views. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these Deities study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>command, identify</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>augury, suggestion</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>nondetection, speak with dead</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>arcane eye, confusion</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>legend lore, scrying</i></p>
<p><b><i>Blessings of Knowledge.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts.</i></b> Gained at level 6. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 12 squares of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 12 squares of you. This effect lasts for 10 rounds. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <i>suggestion</i> spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Potent Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>
<p><b><i>Visions of the Past.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>Object Reading. Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.</p>
<p>Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 15m cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</p>

<br/><h4>Life Domain</h4>
<p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy, one of the fundamental forces of the universe, that sustains all life. The Deities of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>bless, cure wounds</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>lesser restoration, spiritual weapon</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>beacon of hope, revivify</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>death ward, guardian of faith</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>mass cure wounds, raise dead</i></p>
<p><b><i>Disciple of Life.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hp equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>
<p>You also gain proficiency in heavy armor.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life.</i></b> Gained at level 2. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hp equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 6 squares of you, and divide those hp among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its max hp. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>
<p><b><i>Blessed Healer.</i></b> Gained at level 6. The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hp to a creature other than you, you regain hp equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Supreme Healing.</i></b> Gained at level 17. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.</p>

<br/><h4>Light Domain</h4>
<p>Light is mostly a domain of Good, by opposing darkness and deceit. It can also be a cult of the Sun however, of splendour and power, of arts and civilization. Clerics of Light are endowed with inner radiance and tasked with shining their light into the darkest of the world's corners.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>burning hands, faerie fire</i></p>

<p><b><i>Warding Flare.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 6 squares of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker as it strikes. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You also gain the <i>light</i> cantrip, if you don't already know it.</p>
<p><i><b>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn.</b></i> Gained at level 2. You can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 12 squares of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 12 squares of you must make a Constitution save or take radiant damage equal to 2d1O + your cleric level on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>
<p><i><b>Improved Flare.</b></i> Gained at level 6. You can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 12 squares of you attacks a creature other than you.</p>
<p><b><i>Potent Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>
<p><i><b>Corona of Light.</b></i> Gained at level 17. You can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 10 rounds or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 12-square radius and dim light 6 squares beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.</p>

<br/><h4>Nature Domain</h4>
<p>Where Life is concerned with the sentient living, Nature is more concerned with the ecosystem in its entirety, though it is sometimes rather hostile towards intelligent beings, considered to be destroyers of the natural world. Nature is about wild and untamed life, and Clerics of this domain seek to preserve all of the biodiversity, even those who might be perceived as 'evil' by other sentients.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>

Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 6 squares of you must make a Wisdom save or be charmed by you for 10 rounds or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p>
<p><b><i>Dampen Elements.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When you or a creature within 6 squares of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Master of Nature.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.</p>

<br/><h4>Tempest Domain</h4>
<p>Tempest Deities send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath. Tempest is about violence, conflict and power, and as such it is liberally wielded by Deities of all alignments.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>fog cloud, thunderwave</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>gale, shatter</i></p>

The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom moditier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you tinish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity. When you roll for lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.</p>

<p><b><i>Divine Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Stormborn.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.</p>

<br/><h4>Trickery Domain</h4>
<p>The Deities of Trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both Deities and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>charm person, disguise self</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>mirror image, pass without trace</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>blink, dispel magic</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>dimension door, polymorph</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>dominate person, modify memory</i></p>
<p><b><i>Blessing of the Trickster.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You can use your action to touch a willing creature (including yourself) to give it advantage on Stealth checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity.</i></b> Gained at level 2. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 6 squares of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 6 squares to a space you can see, but it must remain within 24 squares of you.</p>
<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 1 square of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows.</i></b> Gained at level 6. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your
next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.</p>

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Duplicity.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 6 squares, to a maximum range of 24 squares.</p>

<br/><h4>War Domain</h4>
<p>War has many manifestations, from reckless violence to honorable matches following strict rules of engagement. Regardless of the Deities' approach to warfare, however, Clerics of this domain are well prepared for open conflict, and will rarely shy away from a battle.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>divine favor, shield of faith</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>magic weapon, spiritual weapon</i></p>
