<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Not every priest at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Most clergy are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving little to no fieldwork on behalf of their Deity. True clerics are those of exceptional faith and grit who go above and beyond in their duty, and thus they are a rare sight in all priestly hierarchies.</p>
<p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her Deity demands it. Pursuing missions bestowed upon it a cleric often braves dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their Deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon lord to enter the world.</p>
<p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths, although owing to their special relationship with their Deity, clerics usually outrank most other clergy. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, but few outside the highest priests are in a position to demand it. Instead it is the clerics who often are tasked with ensuring the theological purity of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Clerics are beholden to the Deity they serve through a binding oath - faithful service in exchange for a daily allowance of magic spells. As such, clerics cannot openly defy their Deity without losing all their powers. In rare cases, clerics do lose faith in one God and take up the service of another, but such a switch is always marked by a grueling task designed to test the faith of the new convert.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + CON. For each new level, gain 5 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light armor, shields, all simple weapons. Awareness and Will. Skills: two choices from Friendliness, History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a mace or (if proficient) a warhammer; scale mail, or leather armor or (if proficient) chain mail; light crossbow and 20 bolts or a simple weapon; a holy symbol (appropriate for your chosen Deity) and a shield; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a priest's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> A cleric starts every day with a short ritual to honor their Deity and prove their continued devotion. The specifics of the ritual vary between Deities, but they all involve some sort of material sacrifice. You must sacrifice appropriate material worth 1 gg per cleric level to perform the ritual, prove your devotion, and thus earn access to cleric spells for the day. At the end of a long rest, you prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Intuition + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You can use Channel Divinity for a number of times and must then finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Turn Undead.</i></b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Roll spellpower vs INT against every undead that can see or hear you within 6 squares of you. On hit an undead is turned for 10 rounds or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 6 squares of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1 or choose a <a href="../rules.html#feats">feat</a>. Once you achieve level 20, ability scores over +5.</p>
<h4>Destroy Undead</h4>
<p>When you successfully use Turn Undead on a creature, it is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, which you can find on the features column of the Class Progression Table.</p>
<h4>Divine Intervention</h4>
<p>You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll d100. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention, which will depended on your Deity. The effect is nevertheless guaranteed to be significant, at least on par with the <i>Wish</i> spell. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>

<br/><h3>Divine Domain</h3>
<p>Although they may wish to appear so, Deities aren't all powerful, and Their purview is limited to one or more Divine Domains. Clerics can therefore only choose a Domain over which their chosen Deity has power.</p>
<p>Each domain has a list of spells that you gain at the c1eric levels noted in the description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

<br/><h4>Death Domain</h4>
<p>The Death domain is concerned only with the necrotic energy emanating from the Shadowfell. It deals in death and undeath, and so its practitioners generally become thoroughly corrupted by necrotic energy, to the point where they are little more than merciless avatars of Death.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>false life, ray of sickness</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>animated dead, vampiric touch</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>blight, death ward</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>antilife shell, cloudkill</i></p>
<p><b><i>Reaper.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You gain proficiency with martial weapons and you learn one animancy cantrip from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip or level 1 spell that normally targets one creature, you can instead target two creatures within range, standing within 1 square of each other.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Touch of Death.</i></b> Gained at level 2. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use channel divinity to deal an extra 5 + twice your cleric level necrotic damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Inescapable Destruction.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You ignore resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Death Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Command Undead.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can use magic to bring undead under your control, regardless of the power that created them. As an action, roll spellpower vs CHA against one undead that you can see within 12 squares (18m) of you. On hit, the creature becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. On failure, you cannot use this feature on the same creature again.</p>
<p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target is clever, you have disadvantage on the roll. If target is sentient, then in addition, you also have to successfully repeat your roll every hour in order to maintain control.</p>
<p><b><i>Lord of the Undead.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Ignore the time limit for maintaining control of undead for a number of the weakest (by CR, ties broken by player) under your command, up to a maximum equal to your Intuition (a minimum of 1). Sentient undead under your command still have to be kept under control every hour, however.</p>

<br/><h4>Knowledge Domain</h4>
<p>Deities with a portfolio in knowledge have many different views. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these Deities study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all that they can.</p>

<p>3rd level: <i>augury, suggestion</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>nondetection, speak with dead</i></p>

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts.</i></b> Gained at level 6. As an action, roll spellpower vs INT against one creature that you can see within 12 squares of you. If you fail the roll, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>On success, you can read the creature's surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 12 squares of you. This effect lasts for 10 rounds. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <i>suggestion</i> spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The spell automatically succeeds without requiring a roll.</p>
<p><b><i>Potent Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You add INT to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>
<p><b><i>Visions of the Past.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>Object Reading. Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the past month, you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.</p>
<p>Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 15m cube), going back at most a month. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important to your current situation.</p>
<p><b><i>Broad Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Through intense study, you have broadened your knowledge of magic spells to the point where you can imitate some magic from other classes. Gain three spells of your choice of level 8 or lower from any class' spell list.</p>

<br/><h4>Life Domain</h4>
<p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy, one of the fundamental forces of the universe, that sustains all life. The Deities of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hp equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 6 squares of you, and divide those hp among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its max hp. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>
<p><b><i>Blessed Healer.</i></b> Gained at level 6. The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hp to a creature other than you, you regain hp equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p><b><i>Supreme Healing.</i></b> Gained at level 17. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.</p>

<br/><h4>Light Domain</h4>
<p>Light is mostly a domain of Good, by opposing darkness and deceit. It can also be a cult of the Sun however, of splendour and power, of arts and civilization. Clerics of Light are endowed with inner radiance and tasked with shining their light into the darkest of the world's corners.</p>

<p>1st level: <i>burning hands, faerie fire</i></p>

<p><b><i>Warding Flare.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 6 squares of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker as it strikes. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to INT (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

You emit bright light in a 12-square radius and dim light 6 squares beyond that. Atacks against enemies in the bright light that would deal fire damage have advantage on their roll.</p>

<br/><h4>Nature Domain</h4>
<p>Where Life is concerned with the sentient living, Nature is more concerned with the ecosystem in its entirety, though it is sometimes rather hostile towards intelligent beings, considered to be destroyers of the natural world. Nature is about wild and untamed life, and Clerics of this domain seek to preserve all of the biodiversity, even those who might be perceived as 'evil' by other sentients.</p>

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target.

<p><b><i>Master of Nature.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You gain the ability to command beasts and plant creatures. While creatures are charmed by your <i>Charm Beasts and Plants</i> feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.</p>

<br/><h4>Tempest Domain</h4>
<p>Tempest Deities send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath. Tempest is about violence, conflict and power, and as such it is liberally wielded by Deities of all alignments.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>fog cloud, thunderwave</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>gale, shatter</i></p>

On hit, the creature takes 2d8 sonic damage, or half as much damage on failure. You can use this feature a number of times equal to INT (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity. When you roll for electric or sonic damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.</p>

<p><b><i>Stormborn.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.</p>

<br/><h4>Trickery Domain</h4>
<p>The Deities of Trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both Deities and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</p>
<p><b><i>Domain Spells.</i></b></p>
<p>1st level: <i>charm person, disguise self</i></p>
<p>3rd level: <i>mirror image, pass without trace</i></p>
<p>5th level: <i>blink, dispel magic</i></p>
<p>7th level: <i>dimension door, polymorph</i></p>
<p>9th level: <i>dominate person, modify memory</i></p>
<p><b><i>Blessing of the Trickster.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You can use your action to touch a willing creature (including yourself) to give it advantage on Stealth checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity.</i></b> Gained at level 2. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 6 squares of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 6 squares to a space you can see, but it must remain within 24 squares of you.</p>
<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 1 square of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p>
<p><b><i>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows.</i></b> Gained at level 6. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your
next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 8. You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison - a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d10 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d10.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Duplicity.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 6 squares, to a maximum range of 24 squares.</p>

<br/><h4>War Domain</h4>
