In this game world, a character's class is equivalent to a profession, or career. It defines an entire lifestyle and way of thinking and doing things. Having a class is therefore like having a college degree in the real world. And just like in the real world, there is some overlap between jobs/classes, but there still are some very clear defining features that make each class feel distinct.
Every class has a main ROLE, which defines its primary purpose in combat. Specializations may add secondary ROLES, but there still should be a very clear sense of purpose for the class. Fuzziness in this regard will make for characters that players don't get a good feel for, or that feel useless (knowing a bit of everything is useless if the team already has a specialist for every role). A clear role will also make the design process smoother.
Every character type (class + specialization) also has one or more sources of power that define the flavor of that class, since the same role can be performed in varied different ways. Unlike with ROLES, a character can tap into several power sources with varying degrees of intensity, which will be reflected in the flavor of their special mechanics.
Note: a similar logic can (and should) be applied to monsters as well, especially those that fight in groups. Solitary monsters need to be more well rounded, but even so, not to the point where they become blandly indistinct.

ROLES:
	Defender - attract the attention of the enemies and absorb damage
	Striker - deal as much damage as possible
	Controller - limit the enemy's options, weaken him or redefine the battlefield
	Leader - enhance ally abilities (includes healing)

POWER SOURCE:
	Martial - raw strength and combat training
	Cunning - intelligent use of the environment and equipment to one's advantage
	Arcane - the reality-altering control over the Weave
	Divine - magic is granted by a Deity which expects obedience to a set of values
	Nature - magic is granted by deep respect for the planet and its ecosystems
