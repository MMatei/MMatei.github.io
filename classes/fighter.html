<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Not every warrior can call himself a Fighter, just like not every priest in service of a Deity can call himself a Cleric. To be acknowledged as a true Fighter, one must become an expert in at least two weapons, though often even more. Of course the Fighter also specializes in a particular fighting style, aiming to excel and hone it to an art form. A Fighter is at home in his/her armor, and their weapon of choice is an extension of their body, wielded efortlessly and with grace. But the Fighter is also comfortable with many different weapons and can handily take down two lesser warriors in a straight fight regardless of the weapon of choice. But true Fighters do not limit themselves to a straight fight, and they learn various tricks and tactics that allow them to outclass several oponents at once.</p>
<p>Always sharpening their skills beyond excellence, Fighters can become the equals of even the mightiest of spellcasters and monsters, and can handily go toe to toe against fearsome demon lords. To underestimate a Fighter is to court an untimely death.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d10. Your starting hp is 10 + Constitution. For each new level, gain 6 + Constitution max hp.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> An armor type of your choice, Firmness, Endurance.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> A gambeson or a jack of plates; a longbow and 20 arrows; a martial weapon and a shield, or two martial weapons; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>, coins worth 15 gg.</p>
<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
<p>You adopt a particular style of combat as your specialty. Provided you get a second choice you cannot choose the same style again.</p>
<p><b><i>Bracer Parry.</i></b> While you are wearing armor, gain +1 to Deflection.</p>
<p><b><i>Crossbow Expert.</i></b> Ignore the loading tag of crossbows with which you are proficient. Being within 1 square of a hostile creature facing you doesn't impose disadvantage on attack rolls with crossbows.</p>
<p><b><i>Duelist.</i></b> When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and the other is free, add your weapon damage as extra damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dual Style.</i></b> Attacks with the second weapon no longer consume an action, but can only be performed once per turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Dual Wielder.</i></b> When fighting with two weapons, you can hold any melee or thrown weapon in the main hand.</p>
<p><b><i>Fluid Style.</i></b> When you are wielding a [finesse] weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your Deflection for that attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Mighty Swings.</i></b> Before you make a melee attack with a [heavy] weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll, but you gain +10 extra damage. In addition, whenever you drop a creature to 0 hp with a [heavy] weapon, you may immediately use a quick action to make a melee attack; the opportunity is lost if you move or take other actions.</p>
<p><b><i>Protector.</i></b> When a creature makes a weapon attack against an ally next to you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided you hold a shield.</p>
<p><b><i>Shield Master.</i></b> Add your shield's Deflection bonus to Firmness and Reflex.</p>
<p><b><i>Sniper.</i></b> Gain +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Steady Blows.</i></b> When you deal damage for an attack you made with a two-handed or versatile weapon that you are wielding with two hands, add +1 to raw damage.</p>

<p>You have a deep well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. Once per short or long rest, you can use a quick action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>
<h4>Action Surge</h4>
<p>You can push yourself beyond your limits for a brief moment, and on a turn you can take two actions. You can only do this once (twice at level 17) before a short or long rest.</p>
<h4>Attribute Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1 or choose a <a href="../rules.html#feats">feat</a>. Once you achieve level 20, you can increase attributes over +5.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make an extra attack (two more at level 11, three more at level 20).</p>
<h4>Indomitable</h4>
<p>Through sheer grit, you may ignore debilitating effects that would fell lesser men. You can force an enemy to repeat an attack roll against you. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Opportunist</h4>
<p>Your attacks of opportunity no longer consume your reaction, and you gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll. Furthermore, situations that otherwise negate an attack of opportunity (such as forced movement) now merely impose disadvantage.</p>

<h3>Martial Archetype</h3>
<h4>Champion</h4>
<p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. They seek absolute perfection in combat, indomitable strength combined with lightning reflexes and pinpoint precision. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p>
<p><b><i>Precise Strikes.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Gain +1 on weapon attack rolls.</p>

<p><b><i>Masterful Defenses.</i></b> Gained at level 22. After constant training and with plenty of battle experience, you have reached the peak of physical capacity. Gain proficiency in a defense type you aren't proficient in.</p>

<br/><h4>Battle Master</h4>
<p>Those who aspire to become Battle Masters learn and employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>
<p><b><i>Combat Superiority.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<p><b><i>Know Your Enemy.</i></b> Gained at level 7. If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to the following characteristics: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Deflection, current hp, total levels, fighter levels. You now have five superiority dice.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Combat Superiority.</i></b> Gained at level 10. Gain another 2 maneuvers. Your superiority dice become d10s.</p>
<p><b><i>Relentless.</i></b> Gained at level 15. Gain another 2 maneuvers. When you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p>
<p><b><i>Combat Supremacy.</i></b> Gained at level 18. Your superiority dice become d12s and you gain one more superiority die.</p>
<p><b><i>Master Tactician.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You develop an almost supernatural instinct for battle, and you can quickly order your team mates in position, even if they are surprised. When initiative is rolled, your allies can move up to 2 squares to better position themselves for the upcoming battle, even if they begin the combat surprised. This effect doesn't stack, and it doesn't trigger if you are surprised.</p>
<br/><p style="color:#7A200D"><b>Combat Maneuvers</b></p>
<p><b><i>Commander's Strike.</i></b> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a quick action to direct one of your companions to strike.

<br/><h4>Spellblade</h4>
<p>Spellblades are as extraordinarily rare as they are powerful. With patience unmatched by the other archetypes, they carefuly study magic to augment their martial mastery common to all fighters. Spellblades use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards, but they focus their study on only two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and protomancy. Abjuration spells grant a Spellblade additional protection in battle, while protomancy spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat.</p>
<p>Spellblades know only limited magic compared to a <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a>, but even this is an extraordinary effort, for they achieve in months what most wizards achieve in years of (admitedly more general) study. Spellblades, just like wizards, need a spellbook in which they write their learned spells, and from where they need to refresh their memory at every long rest. Unlike wizards, however, Spellblades have all their spells prepared at all times, so long as they have perused their spellbook the night prior.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Learn two cantrips, a 1st level spell of your choice, and two 1st level abjuration or protomancy spells from the <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a> spell list.</p>
<p>Your spellpower is equal to your proficiency bonus + Intelligence.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a> spells. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or protomancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a> spells you know with another spell of your choice from the <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a> spell list (abjuration or protomancy, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level).</p>
<p>Your spellbook will always contain merely the spells you know, and further inscriptions are just gibberish to you. You cannot learn any new spells from the writings of others or any other source - your arcane education is very limited and based more on rote memorisation than understanding.</p>
<p><b><i>Weapon Bond.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can bond with up to two weapons through a ritual lasting one hour. You cannot be disarmed of a bonded weapon unless you're incapacitated, and you can summon it to your hand instantly, so long as it is on the same plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>War Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 7. When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can use your quick action to make a weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you have advantage on rolls made on spells you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Learn an additional cantrip from the <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a> spell list.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Charge.</i></b> Gained at level 15. You gain the ability to teleport up to 6 squares to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved War Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 18. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use your quick action to make a weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Sundering Arcana.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained a deeper grasp of arcana, and now you can briefly target the hidden ley lines of a foe, thus weakening their magical defenses. Once per short rest, a successful weapon attack can remove an enemy's resistance to a single damage type, or turn immunity into resistance, until the end of your next turn.</p>
