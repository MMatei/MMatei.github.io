<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Not every warrior can call himself a Fighter. To become one, it is necessary to know how to wield every weapon of note, but also to be a master of particular fighting style. A Fighter is at home in every type of armor and with every selection of weapons, and can handily take down two lesser warriors in a straight fight. But true Fighters do not limit themselves to a straight fight, and they learn various tricks and tactics that allow them to outclass several oponents at once.</p>
<p>Further specializing in a martial archetype, Fighters can become the equals of even the mightiest of sorcerers and warlocks, and can handily go toe to toe against fearsome demon lords. To understimate a Fighter is to risk an untimely death.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d10, so your starting hp is 10 + Constitution. For each new level, gain 1d10 + Constitution.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> All armors and weapons, Firmness, Endurance; choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: chainmail or leather and longbow with 20 arrows; a martial weapon and shield or two martial weapons; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
<p>You adopt a particular style of combat as your specialty. Provided you get a second choice you cannot choose the same style again.</p>
<p><b><i>Bracer Parry.</i></b> While you are wearing armor, gain +1 to Deflection.</p>
<p><b><i>Crossbow Expert.</i></b> Ignore the loading tag of crossbows with which you are proficient. Being within 1 square of a hostile creature facing you doesn't impose disadvantage on attack rolls with crossbows.</p>
<p><b><i>Duelist.</i></b> When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and the other is free, roll an extra damage die when you hit.</p>
<p><b><i>Dual Style.</i></b> Gain +1 to Deflection when wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.</p>
<p><b><i>Dual Wielder.</i></b> When fighting with two weapons, you can hold any melee or thrown weapon in the main hand.</p>
<p><b><i>Fluid Style.</i></b> When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your Deflection for that attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Mighty Swings.</i></b> Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll; but if the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage. In addition, whenever you drop a creature to 0 hp with a heavy weapon, you may immediately use a quick action to make a melee attack; the opportunity is lost if you move or take other actions.</p>
<p><b><i>Protector.</i></b> When a creature makes a weapon attack against an ally next to you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided you hold a shield.</p>
<p><b><i>Shield Master.</i></b> Add your shield's Deflection bonus to Firmness and Reflex.</p>
<p><b><i>Sniper.</i></b> Gain +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Sundering Blows.</i></b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a two-handed or versatile weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>
<p><b><i>Two Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When fighting with two weapons, you can add your damage modifier to the second attack.</p>
<h4>Second Wind</h4>
<p>You have a deep well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. Once per short or long rest, you can use a quick action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>
<h4>Action Surge</h4>
<p>You can push yourself beyond you limits for a brief moment, and on a turn you can take two actions. You can only do this once (twice at level 17) before a short or long rest.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1 or choose a <a href="../rules.html#feats">feat</a>. Once you achieve level 20, ability scores over +5.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make an extra attack (two more at level 11, three more at level 20).</p>
<h4>Indomitable</h4>
<p>Through sheer grit, you may ignore debilitating effects that would fell lesser men. You can force an enemy to repeat an attack roll against you. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Opportunist</h4>
<p>Your attacks of opportunity no longer consume your reaction, and become a critical hit on a roll of 17-20. Furthermore, situations that otherwise negated an attack of opportunity now merely impose disadvantage (such as forced movement).</p>

<h3>Martial Archetype</h3>
<h4>Champion</h4>

<br/><h4>Battle Master</h4>
<p>Those who aspire to become Battle Masters learn and employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>

If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own.

<p><b><i>Combat Supremacy.</i></b> Gained at level 18. Your superiority dice become d12s and you gain one more superiority die.</p>
<p><b><i>Master Tactician.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You develop an almost supernatural instinct for battle, and you can quickly order your team mates in position, even if they are surprised. When initiative is rolled, your allies can move up to 2 squares to better position themselves for the upcoming battle. This effect doesn't stack, and it doesn't trigger if you are surprised.</p>

<br/><h4>Spellblade</h4>
<p>Spellblades are as extraordinarily rare as they are powerful. With patience unmatched by the other archetypes, they carefuly study magic to augment their martial mastery common to all fighters. Spellblades use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards, but they focus their study on only two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and protomancy. Abjuration spells grant a Spellblade additional protection in battle, while protomancy spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat.</p>
<p>Spellblades know only limited magic compared to a wizard, but even this is an awesome effort, for they achieve in months what most wizards achieve in years of (admitedly more general) study. Spellblades, just like wizards, need a spellbook in which they write their learned spells, and from where they need to refresh their memory at every long rest. Unlike wizards, however, Spellblades have all their spells prepared at all times, so long as they have perused their spellbook the night prior.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Gain proficiency in Arcana. Learn two cantrips and a 1st level spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. You also learn two 1st level abjuration or protomancy spells from the wizard spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or protomancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list (abjuration or protomancy, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level).</p>
<p>Your spellbook will always contain merely the spells you know, and further inscriptions are just gibberish to you. You cannot learn any new spells from the writings of others or any other source - your arcane education is very limited and based more on rote memorisation than understanding.</p>
<p><b><i>Weapon Bond.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can bond with up to two weapons through a ritual lasting one hour. You cannot be disarmed of a bonded weapon unless you're incapacitated, and you can summon it to your hand instantly, so long as it is on the same plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>War Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 7. When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can use your quick action to make a weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you have advantage on rolls made on spells you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Learn an additional cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Charge.</i></b> Gained at level 15. You gain the ability to teleport up to 6 squares to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved War Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 18. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use your quick action to make a weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Sundering Arcana.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained a deeper grasp of arcana, and now you can briefly target the hidden ley lines of a foe, thus weakening their magical defenses. Once per short rest, a successful weapon attack can remove an enemy's resistance to a single damage type, or turn immunity into resistance, until the end of your next turn.</p>
