<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>A Fighter is no mere blade wielder. Instead, it describes a person who's devoted its life to mastery of many fighting styles. A fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d10, so your starting hp is 10 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d10 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> All armors and weapons. Saving throws: Strength, Constitution. Skills: choose one from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: chainmail or leather and longbow with 20 arrows; a martial weapon and shield or two martial weapons; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
<p>You adopt a particular style of combat as your specialty. Provided you get a second choice you cannot choose the same style again.</p>
<p><b><i>Archery.</i></b> Gain +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Defense.</i></b> While you are wearing armor, gain +1 to AC.</p>
<p><b><i>Dueling.</i></b> When you are wielding a weapon in one hand and the other is free, gain +2 to damage with that weapon.</p>
<p><b><i>Great Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a two-handed or versatile weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>
<p><b><i>Protection.</i></b> When a creature attacks an ally next to you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided you hold a shield.</p>
<p><b><i>Two Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When fighting with two weapons, you can add your damage modifier to the second attack.</p>
<h4>Second Wind</h4>
<p>You have a deep well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. Once per short or long rest, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>

<p>You can push yourself beyond you limits for a brief moment, and on a turn you can take two actions. You can only do this once (twice at level 17) before a short or long rest.</p>

<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make an extra attack (two more at level 11, three more at level 20).</p>

<p>You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Opportunist</h4>
<p>Your attacks of opportunity no longer consume your reaction. Furthermore, situations that otherwise negated an attack of opportunity now merely impose disadvantage (such as forced movement).</p>

<br/><h4>Battle Master</h4>
<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy.

<p><b><i>Master Tactician.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You develop an almost supernatural instinct for battle, and you can quickly order your team mates in position, even if they are surprised.

<br/><h4>Arcane Knight</h4>
<p>The archetypal Arcane Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Arcane Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and protomancy. Abjuration spells grant an Arcane Knight additional protection in battle, while protomancy spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Gain proficiency in Arcana. Learn two cantrips and a 1st level spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. You also learn two 1st level abjuration or protomancy spells from the wizard spell list.</p>

<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list (abjuration or protomancy, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level).</p>
<p><b><i>Weapon Bond.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can bond with up to two weapons through a ritual lasting one hour. You cannot be disarmed of a bonded weapon unless you're incapacitated, and you can summon it to your hand instantly, so long as it is on the same plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>War Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 7. When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can use your bonus action to make a weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Learn an additional cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Charge.</i></b> Gained at level 15. You gain the ability to teleport up to 6 squares to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.</p>

<p><b><i>Sundering Arcana.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained a deeper grasp of arcana, and now you can briefly target the hidden ley lines of a foe, thus weakening their magical defenses.
