<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the Deities, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spel1 requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>
<p>Wizards live and die by their spel1s. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spel1s as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>
<p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The dosest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d6, so your starting hp is 6 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d6 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows. Saving throws: Int, Wis. Skills: choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a quarterstaff or a dagger; a component pouch or an arcane focus; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a scholar's pack or an explorer's pack</a>; a spellbook.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellbook.</i></b> All your wizard spells are recorded in your spellbook. You start the game with 3 cantrips and 6 first level spells from the wizard list inscribed in your spellbook. Each time you gain a new Wizard level you research two new spells from the wizard list (of a level you can cast) and inscribe them into your spellbook.</p>
<p>When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.</p>
<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book (if you want to make a backup spellbook, for example). This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> At the end of a long rest, you prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorisation. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Most importantly, the save DC for your spells is 8 + proficiency bonus + Int modifier, and the attack modifier for spells is proficiency bonus + Int modifier.</p>
<h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>
<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Spell Mastery</h4>
<p>You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st level wizard spell and a 2nd level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
<h4>Signature Spells</h4>
<p>You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

<h3>Arcane Traditions</h3>
<h4>School of Abjuration</h4>
<p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</p>
<p>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</p>
<p><b><i>Abjuration Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an abjuration spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hp, you take any remaining damage.</p>
<p>While the ward has 0 hp, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Projected Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When a creature that you can see within 6 squares of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hp, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Abjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 10. When you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell Resistence.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have advantage on spell saving throws and you also gain resistence to damage from spells.</p>
<p><b><i>Masterful Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to four times the level of the spell. Abjuration cantrips restore 2 hp.</p>

<h4>School of Conjuration</h4>
<p>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</p>
<p><b><i>Conjuration Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a conjuration spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Minor Conjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 2 squares of you. This object can be no larger than 1 meter cubed on a side and weigh no more than 5kg, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you've seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light for a square. The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Benign Transposition.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can use your action to teleport up to 6 squares to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.</p>
<p><b><i>Focused Conjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 10. While you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Durable Summons.</i></b> Gained at level 14. Any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p>

<h4>School of Divination</h4>
<p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight. Your domain is often mocked by more mainstream wizards, who see divination as a fool's errand. But you know that it is a true art, that can be mastered only by a dedicated few.</p>
<p><b><i>Divination Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a divination spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Portent.</i></b> Gained at level 2. Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<p><b><i>Expert Divination.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot of a level lower than the spell you cast. It can't be higher than 5th level.</p>
<p><b><i>Third Eye.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can use your action to increase your powers of perception. Gain either darkvision for 12 squares, ethereal vision (see in the ethereal plane) for 12 squares, see invisible creatures for 2 squares, or be able to read any language. This benefit lasts until you're incapacitated or take a short or long rest. You can only use this ability once per short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Greater Portent.</i></b> Gained at level 14. The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p>
<p><b><i>Vision of Death.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Your dreams reveal hints of mortal peril. If an attack or effect would drop you to 0 hp or kill you, you manage to avoid it by the skin of your teeth, if it's at all possible. You can only benefit from this effect once per long rest.</p>

<h4>School of Enchantment</h4>
<p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p><b><i>Enchantment Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an enchantment spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Hypnotic Gaze.</i></b> Gained at level 2. Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within a square of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.</p>
<p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than a square away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</p>
<p>Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Instinctive Charm.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When a creature you can see within 6 squares of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.</p>
<p>On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Split Enchantment.</i></b> Gained at level 10. When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st levei or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Alter Memories.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed thc duration of your enchantment spell.</p>

<h4>School of Evocation</h4>
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<p><b><i>Evocation Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an evocation spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Sculpt Spells.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
<p><b><i>Potent Cantrip.</i></b> Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<p><b><i>Empowered Evocation.</i></b> You can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
<p><b><i>Overchannel.</i></b> You can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 5th levei ar lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.</p>
<p>If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>
