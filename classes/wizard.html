<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>A mysterious force that no mortal has yet fully understood, the Weave suffuses the entire world of Neveria, from the core of the elemental planes to the highest and most remote heavens. Despite its name, the Weave is no mere fabric, though it does lie thick in some areas, objects or even creatures, while being sparse in others. Wizards have no command over the Weave, and precious little understanding of it, but are dedicated to bending its powers to their will.</p>
<p>Any intelligent creature can make use of the magic of the Weave, but this is no simple matter. For those not blessed with the gift of a special connection to the Weave, intricate and fragile rituals are the only avenue to magic. Learning how to perform these spells requires long and arduous study and practice. The path of the wizard, therefore, is not for the lazy or the impatient, nor for those who do not appreciate study for its own sake. The arcane rules which unlock the wonders of the Weave are as arbitrary as they are intricate, and no mortal has yet made easy sense of them - countless hours of rote memorisation are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Further compounding the woes of the aspiring reality-shaper is the fact that arcane spells, being so complex and delicate, cannot just be performed at will. Instead, thoughtful and lengthy preparation is required, with as many spells as a wizard's mind can hold being pre-cast, so that they can then be unleashed in a pinch with minimum extra requirements. This means that a wizard's life will always revolve around constant study and practice, only rarely interrupted by the satisfaction of a spell well wrought. Such an existence can be dreary for most people.</p>
<p>For all their woes, a wizard's hard work is amply rewarded with the far-reaching powers that they can master. Very experienced wizards can reach the point where they can almost reshape reality, creating or destroying great works with the flick of a finger. Their patience pays off as they can handle considerably more magic in a day than other spellcasters, and control it far more expertly. A well-prepared wizard makes a very fearsome opponent.</p>
<p>Wizarding schools are stuffy and dreary places, filled with dusty tomes and dry teachers, whose only responsibility is to force students to keep up the pace of learning. Such an environment does little to broaden aspiring wizard's minds, and they tend to be very formulaic, dogmatic, perhaps even anti-social, with a penchant for arrogance born out of a need to justify the long years spent studying. This makes wizards rather unlikely adventurers, for they prefer controlled environments where they have ample time to prepare. Wizards don't really like being rushed, hate being faced with the unforeseen, and positively abhor being faced with physical violence, which they are usually ill-prepared to handle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the lure of lost knowledge is too strong for some wizards to resist, and they set out in search of the arcane. Their whole lives revolve around the strange and unusual, so mysteries only serve to pique their interest. While they can be rather quick to dismiss information that doesn't fit into their often narrow world view, wizards will nevertheless seek it out, driven by the hunger to learn that set them out on this path in the first place.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprising given their poor attitude towards commoners, wizards are viewed with a copious amount of suspicion in the world of Neveria. The degree of hostility varies from place to place, depending on history and how well-known wizards are, but the public is generally distrustful of wizards. Horror stories about necromancy and misused noumancy and umbramancy have turned many a mob against local wizarding guilds, and pogroms of magic users are not wholly uncommon. Those who deal in controversial magics should watch their step carefully, as most people will react with fear or even outright hate.</p>
<p>Rulers and the elite are generally better disposed towards wizards, since they understand the enormous value the service of one can bring them. Court wizards are extremely well paid to help deal with a ruler's problems or to advise and protect him. Such a plum position is coveted by many wizards, since they can then pay others to gather magical secrets for them.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d6, so your starting hp is 6 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d6 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Daggers, darts, quarterstaffs, light crossbows. Saving throws: Memory, Intuition. Skills: Arcana and one choice from Crafting (Alchemy), Crafting (Arcana), History, Linguistics, Mechanics, Medicine, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a quarterstaff or a dagger; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a scholar's pack or an explorer's pack</a>; a spellbook.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellbook.</i></b> All your wizard spells are recorded in your spellbook. You start the game with 3 cantrips and 6 first level spells from the wizard list inscribed in your spellbook. Each time you gain a new Wizard level you research two new spells from the wizard list (of a level you can cast) and inscribe them into your spellbook.</p>
<p>When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.</p>
<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book (if you want to make a backup spellbook, for example). This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 20 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> As part of every long rest, a wizard must prepare his/her spell for the upcoming adventures. Because their command over magic is based on overly complicated formulas that are hard to memorise and perform correctly, much less perform quickly in the heat of battle, wizards must pre-cast their magic for the day. This means poring over their spellbook, and selecting a spell for every available spell slot.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>
<p>By studying your spellbook during a short rest, you can replenish some of the spells you have used, preparing them just as you would during a long rest. Due to the limited time available, and due to fatigue, you can only prepare spells with a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up). Spells can only be prepared for slots of level 5 or lower that have been expended.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Signature Spells</h4>
<p>You have achieved such mastery over certain simple spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st level wizard spell and a 2nd level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without having them prepared in a spell slot. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must prepare them in a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
<h4>Epic Ritual</h4>
<p>You now have the ability to learn and cast <a href="../rules.html#epicRitual">epic rituals</a>. It takes two days of work with minimal distractions, as well as 500 gp, in order to inscribe an epic ritual into your spellbook, and therefore learn it.</p>
<h4>Deep Memory</h4>
<p>After years of studying and performing magic, you have such detailed knowledge that you can, once per short rest, spend an action to replace a spell prepared for a slot with any other in your spellbook.</p>
<h4>Improved Arcane Recovery</h4>
<p>With experience and study, you are now able to more easily recover your spent magicks. When using Arcane Recovery, you can recover spell slots of level 6 or lower with a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up) plus MEM.</p>

<br/><h3>Arcane Traditions</h3>
<p>Although not everyone agrees with the division of magic into various schools, it is already such a well-established tradition that many academies and study groups have been formed around just one of the magic schools. Each is adamant that it is superior to the rest, with long, rambling treatises dedicated to the advantages of some type of magic over the others. So deep is this division that nearly all wizards fall into one camp or the other, whether by conviction or by chance.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean that a student of Abjuration will never use Protomancy, for example. Only the most fanatical of wizards pursue such a debilitating course of action. After all, one thing all wizards have in common is the love of magical lore and power.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Abjuration</h4>
<p>The School of Abjuration is all about magic that blocks, cancels, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</p>
<p>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed. They are also always welcome in any adventuring party, for their ability to shield others from harm can make the difference between life and death.</p>
<p><b><i>Abjuration Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an abjuration spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcane Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + MEM. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hp, you take any remaining damage.</p>
<p>While the ward has 0 hp, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Projected Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When a creature that you can see within 6 squares of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hp, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Abjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 10. When you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make a roll as a part of casting that spell, you add your proficiency bonus to that roll.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell Resistence.</i></b> Gained at level 14. Spells cast against you have disadvantage on rolls and you also gain resistance to damage from spells.</p>
<p><b><i>Masterful Ward.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to four times the level of the spell. Abjuration cantrips restore 2 hp.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Animancy</h4>
<p>The School of Animancy explores the biotic and necrotic energies, the opposing forces behind life and death. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things, as well as the dreaded necrotic energy of the Shadowfell. Animancy can be used both to restore and to drain, to give life or to force unlife in dead bodies. You understand this and wield both powers in balance, seeking power over the whole circle of life and death, not mere subservience to one of these two aspects.</p>
<p>Called animancers, members of this school are too often misunderstood and reviled, but their powers to heal and offer succor are highly sought after.</p>
<p><b><i>Animancy Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an animancy spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Grim Harvest.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Whenever you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hp equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Animancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</p>
<p><b><i>Talented Necromancer.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You add the <i>animate dead</i> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast <i>animate dead</i>, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or ske1eton, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Whenever you create an undead using an animancy spell, it has additional benefits: the creature's max hp is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level and the creature adds your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls.</p>
<p><b><i>Talented Biomancer.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You have gained unique insight in the powers biotic energy confers and on the beautiful duality of life and death. Whenever casting an animancy spell of level 1 or higher, you may direct a windfall of biotic energy towards an ally (including yourself), giving him/her temporary hp equal to three times the spell's level.</p>
<p><b><i>Inured to Undeath.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects. You have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hp maximum can't be reduced.</p>
<p><b><i>Master Animancer.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have learned to wield necrotic and biotic energy seamlessly. Whenever you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can turn it into healing for living creatures; similarly, you can turn a healing effect into necrotic damage.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Conjuration</h4>
<p>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air, though you can also produce dangerous substances to throw at your enemies. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</p>
<p><b><i>Conjuration Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a conjuration spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Minor Conjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 2 squares of you. This object can be no larger than 1 m<sup>3</sup> and weigh no more than 5kg, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you've seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light for a square. The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Benign Transposition.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can use your action to teleport up to 6 squares to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.</p>
<p><b><i>Focused Conjuration.</i></b> Gained at level 10. While you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Durable Summons.</i></b> Gained at level 14. Any creature or object that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p>
<p><b><i>Poisonous Conjurations.</i></b> Gained at level 22. It took a great deal of experimentation, but finally you've been able to perfect the recipe for poison, to make all of your corrosive attacks more dangerous. All conjuration spells that deal acid or poison damage now also inflict the <a href="../conditions/poisoned.html">poisoned</a> condition on the victims for a number of rounds equal to the spell level (cantrips don't inflict this condition).</p>

<br/><h4>School of Divination</h4>
<p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight. Your domain is often mocked by more mainstream wizards, who see divination as a fool's errand. But you know that it is a true art, that can be mastered only by a dedicated few.</p>
<p><b><i>Divination Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a divination spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Portent.</i></b> Gained at level 2. Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any roll made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<p><b><i>Expert Divination.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot of a level lower than the spell you cast. It can't be higher than 5th level.</p>
<p><b><i>Third Eye.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can use your action to increase your powers of perception. Gain either darkvision for 12 squares, ethereal vision (see in the ethereal plane) for 12 squares, see invisible creatures for 2 squares, or be able to read any language. This benefit lasts until you're incapacitated or take a short or long rest. You can only use this ability once per short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Greater Portent.</i></b> Gained at level 14. The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p>
<p><b><i>Vision of Death.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Your dreams reveal hints of mortal peril. If an attack or effect would drop you to 0 hp or kill you, you manage to avoid it by the skin of your teeth instead, if it's at all possible. For example, you dodge the attack, or you have something prepared to help you survive this occasion. If the event leading to death is caused by your actions (for example, you activate a trap), then the DM will warn you of the consequences and allow you to reconsider. You can only benefit from this effect once per long rest.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Noumancy</h4>
<p>As a member of the School of Noumancy, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some noumancers are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most people, unfortunately, assume the latter category whenever they hear of mind magic, however.</p>
<p><b><i>Noumancy Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a noumancy spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Hypnotic Gaze.</i></b> Gained at level 2. Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, roll spellpower vs CHA against one creature that you can see, and that can see or hear you, within a square of you. On hit, it is charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is <a href="../conditions/incapacitated.html">incapacitated</a> and visibly dazed.</p>
<p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than a square away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</p>
<p>Once the effect ends, or if the initial roll fails, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Instinctive Charm.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When a creature you can see within 6 squares of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. Roll spellpower vs INT. On hit, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.</p>
<p>On failure, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Split Enchantment.</i></b> Gained at level 10. When you cast a noumancy spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Alter Memories.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast a noumancy spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. Roll spellpower vs MEM to make it lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your CHA (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your noumancy spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Master Hypnotist.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Your hypnotic powers have been honed to perfection. You can now use your Hypnotic Gaze ability on any creature within 6 squares of you that can either see or hear you. You gain advantage on this check if you are next to the creature, and it can both see and hear you.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Protomancy</h4>
<p>You focus your study on magic that harnesses powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder and crackling lightning. Some protomancers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<p><b><i>Protomancy Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing a protomancy spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Sculpt Spells.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your protomancy spells. When you cast a protomancy spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures aren't affected at all by the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Potent Cantrip.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you fail the roll, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
<p><b><i>Empowered Protomancy.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can add your MEM to the damage roll of any wizard protomancy spell you cast.</p>
<p><b><i>Versatile Protomancy.</i></b> Gained at level 14. After years of experimenting with the varied energies of protomancy, you've reached the point where all elements flow just as easily for you. Whenever you cast a protomancy spell, you can change fire, cold or electric damage into another one of these three, but the spell will deal half as much damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Sustained Firepower.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Unlike the reckless sorcerers, you understand the subtleties of protomancy, and you know how to pace yourself so as to constantly deliver as much firepower as is required. When your casting is done just the right way, you barely break a sweat! After casting a protomancy spell, you can roll spellpower vs 10 + 2 * level of spell slot used. On a success, you regain use of the spell slot you just expended, but the DC for a future such roll increases by 2.</p>

<br/><h4>School of Umbramancy</h4>
<p>You focus your studies on the powers of Shadow and Light that can dazzles or befuddle the senses and trick even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists (including many gnome wizards) are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p>
<p><b><i>Umbramancy Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an umbramancy spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Minor Illusion.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You learn the <i>minor illusion</i> cantrip or, if you already know it, another wizard cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn't count against your total number of known cantrips.</p>
<p>When you cast <i>minor illusion</i>, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Malleable Illusions.</i></b> Gained at level 6. When you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 10 rounds or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p>
<p><b><i>Illusory Self.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll vs AC against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Illusory Reality.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have learned the secret of weaving stronger Shadow into your illusions to bring them closer to reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this once per spell on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 10 rounds. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. However, the object disappears upon taking any damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Life-like Illusions.</i></b> Gained at level 22. You are now a master of shadow magic, and can weave them into solid shapes efortlessly. All of your illusions are now solid, so creatures can no longer realize something is wrong simply by touching them. However, damage will still dispel your illusions (so you can't crush a foe with an illusory rock).</p>

<br/><h4>School of Transmutation</h4>
<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge. Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>
<p><b><i>Transmutation Savant.</i></b> Gained at level 2. The time and cost required for inscribing an transmutation spell is halved.</p>
<p><b><i>Minor Alchemy.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entire1y of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materiais. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 30 cubic cm of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</p>
<p><b><i>Transmuter's Stone.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>
<p>Darkvision out to a range of 12 squares (18m); an increase to speed of 2 squares while the creature is unencumbered; proficiency in Constitution defense; resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit).</p>
<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p>
<p><b><i>Shapechanger.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You add the <i>polymorph</i> spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast polymorph without having it prepared in a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower. Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>
<p><b><i>Master Transmuter.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minor Transformation. You can transmute one nonmagical object, no larger than a 1.5m cube, into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</li>
  <li>Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hp.</li>
  <li>Restore Life. You cast the <i>raise dead</i> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</li>
  <li>Restore Youth. You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, up to the minimum age at each it matured. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Battle Transmutation.</i></b> You have adapted your masterful transmutation techniques for use in combat, to surprise your enemies. Your transmutation spells can now affect objects worn or carried by other creatures.</p>
