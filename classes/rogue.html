<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p>
<p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d8 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light armor, simple weapons, crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords, thieves' tools. Saving throws: Dex, Int. Skills: choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion. Sleight of Hand, and Stealth.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: rapier or shortsword; shortbow with 20 arrows or light crossbow with 20 bolts; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a burglar's pack or a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>; leather armor, two daggers and thieves' tools.</p>
<h4>Expertise</h4>
<p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
<p>You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage (see class progression table) to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is adjacent and facing it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<h4>Thieves' Cant</h4>
<p>During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
<p>In addition, you understand a set of secret symbols that thieves use to mark areas as hideouts, dangerous, note the patrol patterns of guards and other various tidbits that might be of interest to fellow law-breakers.</p>
<h4>Cunning Action</h4>
<p>Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can use your bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Uncanny Dodge</h4>
<p>When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>
<h4>Evasion</h4>
<p>You can nimbly dodge out of the way of damaging area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
<h4>Reliable Talent</h4>
<p>You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
<h4>Blindsense</h4>
<p>If you're able to hear, you're aware of the location of any creature within 2 squares of you.</p>
<h4>Slippery Mind</h4>
<p>Your cunning now enables you to better defend yourself against mental assaults. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saves.</p>
<h4>Elusive</h4>
<p>You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.</p>
<h4>Stroke of Genius</h4>
<p>Your skills are so sharpened, that when success matters most, you'll inevitably obtain it. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>
<h4>Combat Ready</h4>
<p>You're like a coiled spring, ready to pounce on your enemies. Gain +10 on initiative rolls.</p>

<br/><h3>Roguish Archetypes</h3>
<h4>Thief</h4>
<p>Vou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.</p>
<p><b><i>Fast Hands.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Sleight of Hand check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use Object action.</p>
<p><b><i>Second Story Work.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You are a master climber; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a 0.5m * Dex modifier.</p>
<p><b><i>Supreme Sneak.</i></b> Gained at level 9. You gain advantage on Stealth checks provided you move no more than half your speed on the current turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Use Magic Device.</i></b> Gained at level 13. You have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>
<p><b><i>Thief's Reflexes.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative - 10. You can't use this feature when surprised.</p>
<p><b><i>Fast Talker.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Gain +4 on any Deception, Intimidation, Performance or Persuasion roll.</p>

<br/><h4>Assassin</h4>
<p>You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.</p>
<p><b><i>Assassin Proficiencies.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You gain extra proficiencies with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.</p>
<p><b><i>Assassinate.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>
<p><b><i>Infiltration Expertise.</i></b> Gained at level 9. You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.</p>
<p>If you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>
<p><b><i>Impostor.</i></b> Gained at level 13. You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Deception check you make to avoid detection.</p>
<p><b><i>Death Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 18. You become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution save (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Killing Blow.</i></b> Gained at level 22. When you land a critical strike, all damage die are set to their maximum value.</p>

<br/><h4>Arcane Trickster</h4>
<p>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.</p>
<p><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> Learn three cantrips: <i>mage hand</i> and two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at level 10.</p>
<p><b><i>Spells Known.</i></b> You know three 1st level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment or illusion spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list (enchantment or illusion, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level).</p>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. Your spellcasting DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + Int modifier. Your spell attack modifier is proficiency bonus + Int modifier.</p>
<p><b><i>Legerdemain.</i></b> Gained at level 3. When you cast <i>mage hand</i>, the hand is invisible and can perform the following additional tasks: you can retrieve or stow an object into a container held by another creature; you can use thieves' tools to disarm traps or pick locks from a distance.</p>
<p>You can hide these tasks from a creature with a Sleight of Hand contest against their Perception. Moreover, you can use the bonus action provided by Cunning Action to control the hand.</p>
<p><b><i>Magical Ambush.</i></b> Gained at level 9. If you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Versatile Trickster.</i></b> Gained at level 13. You gain the ability to distract targets with your <i>mage hand</i>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within a square of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell Thief.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster. Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell).</p>
<p>For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Surprise!</i></b> Gained at level 22. You have gained mastery over short range teleportation. You can now use your reaction to switch places with with any creature within 6 squares of you.</p>
