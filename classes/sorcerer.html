<h1 align="center">Sorcerer</h1>
<h4>Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have c1aimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon ancestor.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Choose your dragon ancestor; the damage type associated with it is important for later features. You can speak, read and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a social interaction with dragons, your proficiency modifier is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic resilience.</i></b> Your skin is covered by dragon-like scales. As long as you wear no armor, your AC is 13 + Dex modifier. You also gain an additional 1 hp for every level in Sorcerer.</p>
<p><b><i>Elemental affinity.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can spend a sorcery point to gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon ancestor, for 1 hour. When you cast a spell that does damage of the type associated with your dragon ancestor, add your Cha modifier to the damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon wings.</i></b> Gained at level 14. As a bonus action, you can grow a pair of dragon-like wings, that allow you to fly, with the same speed as your normal movement. You can retract these wings at any time with another bonus action. You cannot use this ability if you wear armor that isn't specially constructed with these wings in mind.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic presence.</i></b> Gained at level 18. You can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 12 squares. For 10 rounds or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p><br/>

<h4>Wild Magic</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from an untamed force that left a deep imprint on you. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<p><b><i>Wild magic surge.</i></b> Gained at level 1. A wild magic surge is an uncontrollable outburst of your sorcerous power; it doesn't expend any of your spell slots, doesn't affect your concentration, nor do its spells require any components or concentration. Immediately after casting a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20; on a 1, roll on the wild magic surge table below.</p>
<p><b><i>Tides of chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You gain the power manipulate the chaos of chance in your favor: gain advantage on an attack roll, ability check or saving throw. You regain use of this feature after a long rest, or after a wild magic surge.</p>
<p><b><i>Bend luck.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your powers over chaos now extend to other creatures. Use your reaction and 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the roll as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to another creature's roll. You can react after the creature's roll result is known, but before the effect is described by the DM.</p>
<p><b><i>Controlled chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain a modicum of control over your chaotic powers. When you roll on the wild magic surge table, roll twice and choose the result you want.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell bombardment.</i></b> Gained at level 18. When you roll for damage on a spell and get a maximum on any die, you choose one of the dice, roll it again, and add the result to the total damage.</p><br/>
