<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The Weave is an intimate part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that is ready to be tapped at an instant, for those with the willpower to seize it. The source of this extraordinary gift can be a dragon ancestor, a magical mishap of catastrophic proportions, or intervention by some higher power with an agenda.  Regardless of the source of their power, all sorcerers can produce magic almost without effort and shape it in ways other spellcasters can only dream of. The downside, however, is that using this innate magic is exacting, and while sorcerers can project unparalleled magic force in a short amount of time, such an effort will leave them spent and vulnerable.</p>
<p>While they enjoy great flexibility and freedom in their spellcasting, and they great pride in this, the magical repertoire of a sorcerer is much more limited compared to other spellcasters. Since their power is based on instinct and not training, sorcerers can cast only fairly straightforward spells, and the reality-altering awesome powers of a wizard are beyond them. They are therefore derided by their more scholarly cousins as one trick ponies, or as clueless artillery. But so long as your enemy is ash and you're still standing, what's the problem?</p>
<p>By their very nature, sorcerers are a fairly rare ocurrence in the world, and as such are often misunderstood and feared. This is somewhat justified, for sorcerers are an adventurous and restless folk, the power boiling inside them always driving them towards action. With powers more suited to destruction than healing, sorcerers can be particularly devastating forces, especially since they are not too patient. Discipline is an uncommon sight in sorcerers, but those who do master it are very dangerous indeed.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d6, so your starting hp is 6 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d6 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows. Constitution and Charisma defenses. Skills: Will and one choice from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a light crossbow with 20 bolts or a sling with 500 stone bullets; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>; two daggers.</p>
<p><b><i>Known Spells.</i></b> The class progression table shows how many cantrips and spells you know. You choose new spells to learn from the Sorcerer's list of spells (you can only learn spells of a level you can cast). Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you already know with any other Sorcerer spell.</p>
<h4>Font of Magic</h4>
<p><b><i>Sorcery Points.</i></b> You are a wellspring of magic, and can twist and turn it to better fit your needs, in a way that traditional magic users can only dream of. You can never exceed your maximum sorcery points (see class progression table) and you recover all expended points after a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Flexible Casting.</i></b> A sorceror has immense flexibility in his casting, unlike other magic users. As such, he doesn't have a fixed number of spell slots. Instead, a spell slot must be created on the spot in order to cast a spell, by purchasing it with sorcery points, at the following rates: lvl 1 - 2 pts, lvl 2 - 3 pts, lvl 3 - 5 pts, lvl 4 - 6 pts, lvl 5 - 7 pts, lvl 6 - 9 pts, lvl 7 - 11 pts, lvl 8 - 13 pts, lvl 9 - 16 pts.</p>
<p>Check the class progression table to determine your ability to create spell slots. U means unrestrained. S x means strained; you can only purchase x spell slots normally. If you wish to purchase more, you can do so, but the cost doubles for the first strained use, then it triples and so on. '&mdash;' means that you cannot purchase spell slots of that level.</p>
<h4>Metamagic</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><b><i>Bouncing Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that only affects one creature, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 for cantrips). If you fail to affect the target, you can bounce the spell to another target of your choice within range (resolve as usual, but no further bouncing possible).
<p><b><i>Careful Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that affects all creatures in an area, you can protect a number of creatures equal to your CHA (minimum of one), allowing them to automatically avoid the effects of the spell. To do so, spend 1 sorcery point and choose the protected creatures.</p>
<p><b><i>Distant Spell.</i></b> Spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. If it is a touch spell, it gains a range of 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Empowered Spell.</i></b> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to CHA (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, up to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Heightened Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that requires a roll, you can spend 3 sorcery points to gain advantage against one target.</p>
<p><b><i>Quickened Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to make its casting time 1 bonus action.</p>
<p><b><i>Subtle Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without verbal or somatic components.</p>
<p><b><i>Twinned Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that targets just 1 creature (but not self), you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 for cantrips) in order to target 2 creatures in range with this spell.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Blood Magic</h4>
<p>You have learned how to sacrifice your very life essence in order to enhance your magic. Once per long rest, you can use an action to drain your very lifeforce and turn it into magical power. Choose a number smaller than your current hit points. Your maximum hp is lowered by that number and you cannot gain temporary hp (any you already have are dispelled), but you immediately gain sorcery points equal to half that number. This condition only ends upon completing a long rest.</p>
<h4>Improved Blood Magic</h4>
<p>Once per long rest, you can use Blood Magic on a willing creature you can touch, draining their lifeforce to feed your power. This ability ignores any protection that prevents loss of maximum hp (eg: wizard's Inured to Undeath ability).</p>

<br/><h3>Sorcerous Origins</h3>
<h4>Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from either a dragon ancestor or a pact made with a dragon. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have c1aimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. Due to the adventurous life of a sorcerer, most such bloodlines do not endure too long.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon ancestor.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Choose your dragon ancestor; the damage type associated with it is important for later features. You can speak, read and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a social interaction with dragons, your proficiency modifier is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic resilience.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Your skin is covered by dragon-like scales. As long as you wear no armor, your AC is 13 + DEX. You also gain an additional 1 hp for every level in Sorcerer.</p>
<p><b><i>Elemental affinity.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon ancestor. Furthermore, any time you cast a spell that does damage of the type associated with your dragon ancestor, add CHA to the damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon wings.</i></b> Gained at level 14. As a bonus action, you can grow a pair of dragon-like wings, that allow you to fly, with the same speed as your normal movement. You can retract these wings at any time with another bonus action. You cannot use this ability if you wear armor that isn't specially constructed with these wings in mind.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic presence.</i></b> Gained at level 18. You can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 12 squares. For 10 rounds or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), roll spellpower vs CHA against every hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura. On hit, the creature is <a href="../conditions/charmed.html">charmed</a> (if you chose awe) or <a href="../conditions/frightened.html">frightened</a> (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. On failure, the creature is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Mass resistance.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Once per short rest, as a bonus action, you can channel the power of your ancestor dragon and bestow it to all friendly creatures within 6 squares of you. They gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon ancestor for 10 rounds.</p>

<h4>Wild Magic</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from an untamed surge of the Weave that left a deep imprint on you. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw and uncontrolled magic, perhaps in the aftermath of a magical catastrophe, or by exposure to an extra-planar realm while in the womb. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<p><b><i>Wild magic surge.</i></b> Gained at level 1. A wild magic surge is an uncontrollable outburst of your sorcerous power; it doesn't expend any of your spell slots, doesn't affect your concentration, nor do its spells require any components or concentration. Immediately after casting a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20; on a 1, roll on the wild magic surge table below.</p>
<p><b><i>Tides of chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You gain the power manipulate the chaos of chance in your favor: gain advantage on one roll you make. You regain use of this feature after a long rest, or after a wild magic surge.</p>
<p><b><i>Bend luck.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your powers over chaos now extend to other creatures. Use your reaction and 2 sorcery points to roll 1d6 and apply the roll as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to another creature's roll. You can react after the creature's roll result is known, but before the effect is described by the DM.</p>
<p><b><i>Controlled chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain a modicum of control over your chaotic powers. When you roll on the wild magic surge table, roll twice and choose the result you want.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell bombardment.</i></b> Gained at level 18. When you roll for damage on a spell and get a maximum on any die, you choose one of the dice, roll it again, and add the result to the total damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaos triumphant.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Wild magic surges now happen on a roll of 1-3. Roll three times on the wild magic surge table and choose the result you want.</p>

<h4>Favored Soul</h4>
<p>Your innate magic is a gift from a Deity, or the result of a Celestial ancestor. Especially if created, your patron Deity might expect you to return the favor by helping It pursue Its agenda. Unlike clerics or paladins, however, a favored soul has complete freedom to pursue their own path without fear of losing their powers, but might still encounter reminders (gentle or not) to return to the path charted by their creator.</p>
<p>Favored souls, with their natural magnetism and strong personalities, are often seen as threats by traditional religious hierarchies. As outsiders who command the power of a Deity and can claim a direct link to it, these sorcerers can undermine or take over the existing order. Even if they are compelled to obey by command of their Deity, those priests whose position is being undermined may quietly seek to undermine the favored soul.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Magic.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Due to your divine heritage, you also have access to the Cleric spell list when learning new spells.</p>
<p><b><i>Blessed Countenance.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Your divine heritage is evident in your countenance, and none can deny your status. When making a Charisma check (except Will), double your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Favor.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your path is not meant to end here. If reduced to 0 hp, you are instead reduced to 1 hp and given a second chance. Once you use this feature, it cannot be used again until you take a long rest. When dropping to 0 hp you are always stable unless you are attacked again.</p>
<p><b><i>Overchannel.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have learned how to push the limits of your magical abilities. Once per long rest, when rolling for damage or healing, you can set all dice to maximum value. Furthermore, you also spend 1 sorcery point to roll a number of additional dice equal to half your CHA, rounded up.</p>
<p>You may use this feature again, but will suffer 2d12 necrotic damage that cannot be mitigated by any means. Any further use adds a further 1d12 to the damage suffered.</p>
<p><b><i>Effortless Concentration.</i></b> Gained at level 18. Armed with divine willpower, self-discipline and patience uncommon in a sorcerer, you have learned how to maintain concentration on two spells at once. Your concentration can still be broken, but you roll separately for each spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Supernatural Speed.</i></b> Gained at level 22. The divine power within you allows you to act faster than would normally be possible. Add your CHA when rolling for initiative.</p>
