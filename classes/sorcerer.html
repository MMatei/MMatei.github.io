<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Magic is an innate part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways. Perhaps a gift from a fey or a fiend, or maybe as a result of a powerful magical event. What matters is that you are so infused with raw magic, that you can project it at will, with no need for the cumbersome formulas of wizards or the patronage of higher entities.</p>
<p>Sorcerers are a fairly rare ocurrence in the world, and as such are often misunderstood and feared. This is partly justified, for the raw powers of sorcers sometimes manifests itself without express intent, leading on occasion to disastrous results. Without exception, sorcerers are adventurous folk, for the magic within fills them with energy and makes them restless.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d6, so your starting hp is 6 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d6 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows. Saving throws: Con, Cha. Skills: choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a light crossbow with 20 bolts or a sling with 500 stone bullets; a component pouch or an arcane focus; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>; two daggers.</p>
<p><b><i>Known Spells.</i></b> The class progression table shows how many cantrips and spells you know. You choose new spells to learn from the Sorcerer's list of spells (you can only learn spells of a level you can cast). Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you already know with any other Sorcerer spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Most importantly, the save DC for your spells is 8 + proficiency bonus + Cha modifier, and the attack modifier for spells is proficiency bonus + Cha modifier.</p>
<h4>Font of Magic</h4>
<p><b><i>Sorcery Points.</i></b> You are a wellspring of magic, and can twist and turn it to better fit your needs, in a way that traditional magic users can only dream of. You can never exceed your maximum sorcery points (see class progression table) and you recover all expended points after a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Flexible Casting.</i></b> You can use a bonus action to convert sorcery points into a spell slot. You can also convert a spell slot into sorcery points, at the following rates: lvl 1 - 2 pts, lvl 2 - 3 pts, lvl 3 - 5 pts, lvl 4 - 6 pts, lvl 5 - 7 pts. Levels higher than 5 cannot be converted.</p>
<h4>Metamagic</h4>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. Vou gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><b><i>Careful Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that forces a saving throw, you can protect a number of creatures equal to your Cha modifier (minimum of one), allowing them to automatically succeed on the save. To do so, spend 1 sorcery point and choose the protected creatures.</p>
<p><b><i>Distant Spell.</i></b> Spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. If it is a touch spell, it gains a range of 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Empowered Spell.</i></b> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Extended Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, up to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Heightened Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that forces a saving throw, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target disadvantage on the first save against the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Quickened Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to make its casting time 1 bonus action.</p>
<p><b><i>Subtle Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without verbal or somatic components.</p>
<p><b><i>Twinned Spell.</i></b> When you cast a spell that targets just 1 creature (but not self), you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (1 for cantrips) in order to target 2 creatures in range with this spell.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Sorcerous Restoration</h4>
<p>You regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p>
<h4>Overpowered Spell</h4>
<p>The <i>Empowered Spell</i> metamagic feat changes, so that now you get to choose which of the dice rolls you want to use. In addition, you can spend an extra sorcery point to roll another damage die (not subject to the previous benefit).</p>

<br/><h3>Sorcerous Origins</h3>
<h4>Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have c1aimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon ancestor.</i></b> Gained at level 1. Choose your dragon ancestor; the damage type associated with it is important for later features. You can speak, read and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a social interaction with dragons, your proficiency modifier is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic resilience.</i></b> Your skin is covered by dragon-like scales. As long as you wear no armor, your AC is 13 + Dex modifier. You also gain an additional 1 hp for every level in Sorcerer.</p>
<p><b><i>Elemental affinity.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can spend a sorcery point to gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon ancestor, for 1 hour. When you cast a spell that does damage of the type associated with your dragon ancestor, add your Cha modifier to the damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dragon wings.</i></b> Gained at level 14. As a bonus action, you can grow a pair of dragon-like wings, that allow you to fly, with the same speed as your normal movement. You can retract these wings at any time with another bonus action. You cannot use this ability if you wear armor that isn't specially constructed with these wings in mind.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic presence.</i></b> Gained at level 18. You can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 12 squares. For 10 rounds or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (with DC determined by your spell save) or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic breath.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Once per short rest, as an action, you can channel the power of your ancestor dragon into a fearsome conical breath attack, 3 squares deep, that deals 3d10 damage of the type corresponding to your chosen ancestor.</p>

<h4>Wild Magic</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from an untamed force that left a deep imprint on you. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<p><b><i>Wild magic surge.</i></b> Gained at level 1. A wild magic surge is an uncontrollable outburst of your sorcerous power; it doesn't expend any of your spell slots, doesn't affect your concentration, nor do its spells require any components or concentration. Immediately after casting a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20; on a 1, roll on the wild magic surge table below.</p>
<p><b><i>Tides of chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 1. You gain the power manipulate the chaos of chance in your favor: gain advantage on an attack roll, ability check or saving throw. You regain use of this feature after a long rest, or after a wild magic surge.</p>
<p><b><i>Bend luck.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your powers over chaos now extend to other creatures. Use your reaction and 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the roll as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to another creature's roll. You can react after the creature's roll result is known, but before the effect is described by the DM.</p>
<p><b><i>Controlled chaos.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain a modicum of control over your chaotic powers. When you roll on the wild magic surge table, roll twice and choose the result you want.</p>
<p><b><i>Spell bombardment.</i></b> Gained at level 18. When you roll for damage on a spell and get a maximum on any die, you choose one of the dice, roll it again, and add the result to the total damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Chaos triumphant.</i></b> Gained at level 22. Wild magic surges now happen on a roll of 1-3. Roll three times on the wild magic surge table and choose the result you want.</p>
