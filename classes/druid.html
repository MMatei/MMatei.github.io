<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Druid revere nature above all, often to the detriment of Deities. Though in some setting they may derive their powers from some kind of Nature Deity, in others the druids draw magic from the natural world. Either way, druids will fight hard to ensure the preservation of nature.</p>
<p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals: the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of raw elements clashing in the untamed parts of the world. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>
<p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind f1ayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d8 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields, except for those made of metal, all simple weapons; druids will never wear armor made of metal; Herbalism Kit. Saving throws: Int, Wis. Skills: choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a wooden shield or any simple weapon; a scimitar or a any simple weapon; leather armor, a druidic focus and an <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Preparing Spells.</i></b> At the end of a long rest, you prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid levei (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Most importantly, the save DC for your spells is 8 + proficiency bonus + Wis modifier, and the attack modifier for spells is proficiency bonus + Wis modifier.</p>
<h4>Druidic</h4>
<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Perception check but can't decipher it without magic.</p>
<h4>Wild Shape</h4>
<p>You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into. At level 2 you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. At level 4 you can choose a beast with a CR of 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. At level 8 you can choose any beast with a CR of 1 or lower.</p>
<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hp, or die.</p>
<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
  <li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hp. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hp you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hp, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hp, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>
  <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.</li>
  <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
  <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Beast Spells</h4>
<p>You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p>
<h4>Archdruid</h4>
<p>You can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Furthermore, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>

<br/><h3>Druidic Circles</h3>
<p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of a druidic circle or another, which groups common perspectives on nature, balance, and the way to best presreve it. Some individuals, however, can be so isolated that they may never lay eyes upon any high-ranking members of the society or participate in druidic gatherings. All druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters, however, though the degree of cooperation between them may vary.</p>
<p>Druids can sometimes give themselves over to their primeval nature and behave little better than common beasts, defending their territory against any they deem to be intruders.</p>
<br/><h4>Circle of the Land</h4>
<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing slones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the worship of nature, and they serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.</p>
<p>As a member of such a circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p>
<p><b><i>Bonus Cantrip.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>
<p><b><i>Natural Recovery.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slols can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Circle Spells.</i></b> Gained at levels 3, 5, 7, 9. Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid, Choose that land (arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland. mountain, swamp, or Underdark) and consult the associated list of spells.</p>
<p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

<p><b><i>Land's Stride.</i></b> Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <i>entangle</i> spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature's Ward.</i></b> You can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature's Sanctuary.</i></b> Creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>

<br/><h4>Circle of the Moon</h4>
<p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p>
<p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.</p>
<p><b><i>Combat Wild Shape.</i></b> Gained at level 2. You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape. you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hp per levei of the spell slot expended.</p>
<p><b><i>Circle Forms.</i></b> Gained at level 2, 6. The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you must still abide by the other limitations for your level). Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>
<p><b><i>Primal Strike.</i></b> Gained at level 6. Your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Elemental Wild Shape.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p>
<p><b><i>Thousand Forms.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the <i>alter self</i> spell at will.</p>
