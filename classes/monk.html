<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Monasteries are reclusive places of silent contemplation, more often dedicated to a concept than to a Deity. Here, all are welcome to become monks, so long as they completely leave behind their former life and shun all contacts with the outside world. Monks are to train and meditate, a process that is said to help one attain a better understanding of the world. This process is individual, and masters offer little advice and certainly no conclusions - every monk must find his own enlightenment.</p>
<p>Monks train for years in order to reach complete mastery over their body. With supreme self-discipline and patience, they can harness an inner power, which they call ki, in order to perform supernatural physical feats. They become attuned to this power within them and employ it in various techniques, with each monastic order priding itself on particular signature moves. The ki is somewhat similar to the attunement to nature that the druids achieve, but it comes from within, not without.</p>
<p>Not everyone who lives in a monastery becomes a monk - that takes an iron will supplemented by years of hard training, as well as no small measure of natural aptitude. Those who live in a monastery but have yet to fully graduate as monks are called friars - and although their combat skills can still be impressive, they differ from monks in that they cannot access their ki.</p>
<p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means abandoning a structured and secluded life that was all they knew for whole years. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. Reasons for leaving a monastery depend on a monk's order - some orders routinely interfer in the outside world as paid assassins or defenders of the meek, while others send only the occasional emissary to locate a text or artifact central to their doctrine.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d8, so your starting hp is 8 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d8 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Simple weapons and shortswords. Choose one type of artisan's tools or a musical instrument. Strength and Dexterity defenses. Skills: Attunement and one choice from Acrobatics, Athletics, Craft, Escape Artist, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: a shortsword or any simple weapon; 10 darts; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">a dungeoneer's pack or an explorer's pack</a>.</p>
<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
<p>While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + DEX + INT.</p>
<h4>Martial Arts</h4>
<p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property. Certain monastic orders have signature monk weapons, such as nunchaku (two lengths of wood connected by a short chain) or kama (a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade).</p>
<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>
<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ki</h4>
<p>Your training allows you to harness the mystic inner energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.</p>
<p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>
<p>Some of your ki features require you to roll spellpower, which is defined as proficiency bonus + INT.</p>
<p><b><i>Flurry of blows.</i></b> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>
<p><b><i>Patient Defense.</i></b> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Step of the Wind.</i></b> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>
<h4>Unarmored Movement</h4>
<p>Your speed increases by the amount shown on the Unarmored Movement column of the class progression table, while not wearing armor or shield.</p>
<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move (but can't stop without falling).</p>
<h4>Deflect Missiles</h4>
<p>You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + DEX + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action, you can make an extra attack.</p>
<h4>Slow Fall</h4>
<p>You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>
<h4>Stunning Strike</h4>
<p>You have learned a number of pressure points than can reliably stun an opponent. When you hit another creature with a melee attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. Roll spellpower vs CON in order to stun the opponent until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h4>Ki Strike</h4>
<p>Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<h4>Evasion</h4>
<p>Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that attacks your Dexterity whose failure would still deal half damage, then you take half damage if it succeeeds, and no damage if it fails.</p>
<h4>Stillness of Mind</h4>
<p>You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>
<h4>Purity of Body</h4>
<p>Your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>
<h4>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h4>
<p>You learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>
<h4>Diamond Soul</h4>
<p>Your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all defenses. Additionally, whenever an attack against these defenses succeeds, you can spend 1 ki point to force the opponent to roll again.</p>
<p>Timeless Body</p>
<p>Your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>
<h4>Empty Body</h4>
<p>You can spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 10 rounds. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <i>astral projection</i> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.</p>
<h4>Perfect Self</h4>
<p>When you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>
<h4>Sixth Sense</h4>
<p>You are keenly aware of your surroundings, to the point where little can take you by surprise anymore. You no longer have a rear arc (so your orientation no longer matters) and you have truesight for 1 square around you.</p>

<br/><h3>Monastic Traditions</h3>
<p>There are monastic traditions aplenty across the multiverse, but there are three important ones that are useful to adventuring monks - these traditions focus on excellence in combat, in one form or another. Although they may carry different names in different places, they describe the same set of techniques, that represent the pinnacle of mortal mastery over one's body.</p>
<h4>Way of the Open Hand</h4>
<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of the body, whether it is their own, or that of their opponent. They learn techniques to push and trip their enemies, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</p>
<p><b><i>Open Hand Technique.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Roll spellpower vs DEX to knock it prone.</li>
  <li>Roll spellpower vs STR to push it up to 3 squares away from you.</li>
  <li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Wholeness of Body.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
<p><b><i>Tranquility.</i></b> Gained at level 11. You can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a <i>sanctuary</i> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal).</p>
<p><b><i>Quivering Palm.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, roll spellpower vs CON. On hit, the creature is reduced to 0 hp. On miss, the creature takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p>
<p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p>

<br/><h4>Way of the Shadow</h4>
<p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</p>
<p><b><i>Shadow Arts.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast <i>darkness, darkvision, pass without trace,</i> or <i>silence</i>, without providing material components. Additionally. you gain the <i>minor illusion</i> cantrip if you don't already know it.</p>
<p><b><i>Shadow Step.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 12 squares (18m) to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Cloak of Shadows.</i></b> Gained at level 11. You have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>
<p><b><i>Opportunist.</i></b> Gained at level 17. You can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 1 square of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.</p>

<br/><h4>Way of the Four Elements</h4>
<p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together. Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains and cresting waves.</p>
<p><b><i>Disciple of the Elements.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other discipline of your choice, which are detailed below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at levels 6, 11, 17 and 21.</p>
<p>Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. You don't need to provide material components for these spells. Once you reach level 5 in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend.</p>
<p>You can only spend a maximum number of ki points on spells, according to your monk level, as follows: levels 5 to 8 - 3 ki points; levels 9 to 12 - 4 ki points; levels 13 to 16 - 5 ki points; levels 17 to 20 - 6 ki points; levels 21 to 23 - 7 ki points.</p>
<p><b><i>Shaper of the Elements.</i></b> Gained at level 21. You are now finely attuned to the elements and can more readily call upon them for aid. You spend one less ki point when activating an elemental discipline.</p>
<br/><p style="color:#7A200D">Elemental Disciplines</p>
