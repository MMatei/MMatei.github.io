<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature: keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>
<p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
<p>Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian c1ass. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d12, so your starting hp is 12 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d12 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields and simple and martial weapons. Saving throws: Str, Con. Skills: choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: greataxe or a martial weapon; two handaxes or any simple weapon; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">an explorer's pack</a> and four javelins.</p>
<h4>Rage</h4>
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You can use your bonus action to fly into a rage, which grants the following effects (but only so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor):</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have advantage on Str checks and saves.</li>
  <li>When you make a melee attack using Str, you gain bonus damage, as described in the 'Rage Damage' column in the class progression table.</li>
  <li>You have resistance to crushing, piercing and slashing damage.</li>
  <li>If you are able to cast spells (from multiclassing), you can't use them in this state, nor can you concentrate on a spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your rage lasts for 10 rounds. It ends early if you're knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or haven't suffered damage for the last round. You can also end your rage on your turn, using your bonus action.</p>
<p>Once you have raged for the number of times shown in the class progression table, you have to take a Long Rest before you can rage again.</p>
<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
<p>While not wearing armor, your AC is 10 + Dex modifier + Con modifer. You can wear a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
<h4>Reckless Attack</h4>
<p>You throw all caution to the wind and attack with fierce desperation, paying no heed to your defenses. When you make your first attack on your turn you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee attack rolls this turn, but also gives enemies advantage on attack rolls against you.</p>
<h4>Danger Sense</h4>
<p>You gain an uncanny ability to see when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge in rolling away from danger. You have advantage on Dex saves against harmful effects that you can see. To gain this benefit, you cannot be blinded, deafened or incapacitated.</p>
