<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature: keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>
<p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
<p>Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian c1ass. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d12, so your starting hp is 12 + Con modifier. For each new level, gain 1d12 + Con.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields and simple and martial weapons. Saving throws: Str, Con. Skills: choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: greataxe or a martial weapon; two handaxes or any simple weapon; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">an explorer's pack</a> and four javelins.</p>
<h4>Rage</h4>
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You can use your bonus action to fly into a rage, which grants the following effects (but only so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor):</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have advantage on Str checks and saves.</li>
  <li>When you make a melee attack using Str, you gain bonus damage, as described in the 'Rage Damage' column in the class progression table.</li>
  <li>You have resistance to crushing, piercing and slashing damage.</li>
  <li>If you are able to cast spells (from multiclassing), you can't use them in this state, nor can you concentrate on a spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your rage lasts for 10 rounds. It ends early if you're knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or haven't suffered damage for the last round. You can also end your rage on your turn, using your bonus action.</p>
<p>Once you have raged for the number of times shown in the class progression table, you have to take a Long Rest before you can rage again.</p>
<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
<p>While not wearing armor, your AC is 10 + Dex modifier + Con modifer. You can wear a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
<h4>Reckless Attack</h4>
<p>You throw all caution to the wind and attack with fierce desperation, paying no heed to your defenses. When you make your first attack on your turn you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee attack rolls this turn, but also gives enemies advantage on attack rolls against you.</p>
<h4>Danger Sense</h4>
<p>You gain an uncanny ability to see when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge in rolling away from danger. You have advantage on Dex saves against harmful effects that you can see. To gain this benefit, you cannot be blinded, deafened or incapacitated.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase one ability score by 2 points, or two ability scores by 1. You cannot, however, increase an attribute over 20. This limitation is removed, however, once you achieve level 20.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action you can attack twice.</p>
<h4>Fast Movement</h4>
<p>While not wearing heavy armor, your speed increases by 2 squares.</p>
<h4>Feral Instinct</h4>
<p>Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>
<h4>Brutal Critical</h4>
<p>You can roll an additional number of weapon damage dice when scoring a critical hit.</p>
<h4>Relentless Rage</h4>
<p>Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to O hp while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hp instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
<h4>Persistent Rage</h4>
<p>Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
<h4>Indomitable Might</h4>
<p>If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>
<h4>Primal Champion</h4>
<p>You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4.</p>
<br/><h3>Primal Path</h3>

<h4>Path of the Berserker</h4>
<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>
<p><b><i>Frenzy.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p><b><i>Mindless Rage.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>
<p><b><i>Intimidating Presence.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 6 squares of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effeet ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 12 squares away from you.</p>
<p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Retaliation.</i></b> Gained at level 14. When you take damage from a creature that is within 1 square of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>

<h4>Path of the Totem Warrior</h4>
<p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your inner fire.</p>
<p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>
<p><b><i>Spirit Seeker.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <i>beast sense</i> and <i>speak with animals</i> spells, but only as rituals.</p>
<p><b><i>Totem Spirit.</i></b> Gained at level 3. When you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physiral totem object, an amulet or similar adornment, that incorporates fur or feathers, c1aws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example. if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>
<p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example. you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>
<p>Bear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p>
<p>Eagle. While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p>
<p>Wolf. While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 1 square of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
<p><b><i>Aspect of the Beast.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p>
<p>Bear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p>
<p>Eagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 2km away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 30m from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Perception checks.</p>
<p>Wolf. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.</p>
<p><b><i>Spirit Walker.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can cast the <i>commune with nature</i> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animais you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p>
<p><b><i>Totemic Attunement.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
<p>Bear. While you're raging, any hostile creature within 1 square of you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effeet if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p>
<p>Eagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>
<p>Wolf. While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with a melee weapon attack.</p>
