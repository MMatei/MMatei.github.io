<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is best left behind on the battlefield, where primal instincts reign supreme. Only the strong survive in battle, and to do so one needs keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.</p>
<p>Berserkers relish combat - it is only while fighting and spilling blood that they feel truly alive. They have learned to harness their inner animal and enter a rage that gives them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
<p>Although civilized people might think this to be true, not every member of a so-called "barbarian" tribe is a Berserker, just like not every warrior is a Fighter. Berserkers are those individuals strong and fierce enough to embrace this difficult path. They are war leaders and heroes, who charge at the head of their tribe. Furthermore, "civilized" people don't necessarily shy away from the path of the berserker, although they may pick a more fancy name, such as zealot. Whoever learns to master their own rage can become a berserker.</p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p><b><i>Hit Points.</i></b> Your hit die is d12, so your starting hp is 12 + CON. For each new level, gain 1d12 + CON.</p>
<p><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> Light and medium armor, shields and simple and martial weapons. Strength and Constitution defenses. Skills: two choices from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Force, Nature, Perception, and Survival.</p>
<p><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> In addition to equipment granted by your background: greataxe or a martial weapon; two handaxes or any simple weapon; <a href="../rules.html#equipmentPacks">an explorer's pack</a> and four javelins.</p>
<h4>Rage</h4>
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You can use your bonus action to fly into a rage, which grants the following effects (but only so long as you aren't wearing heavy armor):</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and +5 to STR defense.</li>
  <li>When you make a melee attack using STR, you gain bonus damage, as described in the 'Rage Damage' column in the class progression table.</li>
  <li>You have resistance to crushing, piercing and slashing damage.</li>
  <li>If you are able to cast spells (from multiclassing), you can't use them in this state, nor can you concentrate on a spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your rage lasts for 10 rounds. It ends early if you're knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or haven't suffered damage for the last round. You can also end your rage on your turn, using your bonus action.</p>
<p>Once you have raged for the number of times shown in the class progression table, you have to take a Long Rest before you can rage again.</p>
<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
<p>While not wearing armor, your AC is 10 + DEX + CON. You can wear a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
<h4>Reckless Attack</h4>
<p>You throw all caution to the wind and attack with fierce desperation, paying no heed to your defenses. When you make your first attack on your turn you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee attack rolls this turn, but also gives enemies advantage on attack rolls vs AC against you.</p>
<h4>Danger Sense</h4>
<p>You gain an uncanny ability to see when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge in rolling away from danger. Harmful effects that you can see have disadvantage on rolls vs DEX against you. To gain this benefit, you cannot be blinded, deafened or incapacitated.</p>
<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
<p>Increase any one ability score under +5 by +1. Once you achieve level 20, this limitation is removed.</p>
<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
<p>When taking the Attack action you can attack twice.</p>
<h4>Fast Movement</h4>
<p>While not wearing heavy armor, your speed increases by 2 squares.</p>
<h4>Feral Instinct</h4>
<p>Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>
<h4>Brutal Critical</h4>
<p>You can roll an additional number of weapon damage dice (noted in parantheses) when scoring a critical hit.</p>
<h4>Relentless Rage</h4>
<p>Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hp while you're raging and don't die outright, you can roll Athletics vs 10 to drop to 1 hp instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
<h4>Persistent Rage</h4>
<p>Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
<h4>Indomitable Might</h4>
<p>You can no longer fail Strength rolls with a DC less than 10 + 2 * STR. Gain +1 to STR defense.</p>
<h4>Primal Champion</h4>
<p>You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution modifiers increase by +2 each.</p>
<h4>Battle Scars</h4>
<p>As a surivor of many conflicts, you have developed an unnatural resilience to damage of all sorts, as well as unparalleled will to live through injuries that may bring down lesser people. Gain 4 * CON to your max hp.</p>

<br/><h3>Primal Path</h3>
<h4>Path of the Reaver</h4>
<p>For some berserkers, violence alone is the determinant of victory in battle. These individuals follow the Path of the Reaver, a path of untrammeled fury slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. All that matters is hurting the enemy more than they can hurt you.</p>
<p><b><i>Frenzy.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p><b><i>Mindless Rage.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>
<p><b><i>Reckless.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can gain advantage on all melee attack rolls for this turn, but attack rolls vs AC against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Retaliation.</i></b> Gained at level 14. When you take damage from a creature that is within 1 square of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Tireless Frenzy.</i></b> Gained at level 21. You no longer suffer exhaustion at the end of a frenzied rage.</p>

<br/><h4>Path of the Totem Warrior</h4>
<p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the berserker accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your inner fire. The totem warrior fights in a more controlled manner, aiming to protect his tribesmen by drawing the ire of the enemy. Just as the animal is a totem for the berserker, so is he a totem for his tribe.</p>
<p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>
<p><b><i>Spirit Seeker.</i></b> Gained at level 3. Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <i>beast sense</i> and <i>speak with animals</i> spells, but only as rituals.</p>
<p><b><i>Totem Spirit.</i></b> Gained at level 3. When you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object, an amulet or similar adornment, that incorporates fur or feathers, c1aws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example. if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>
<p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example. you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>
<p><u>Bear.</u> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p>
<p><u>Eagle.</u> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p>
<p><u>Wolf.</u> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 1 square of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
<p><b><i>Aspect of the Beast.</i></b> Gained at level 6. You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p>
<p><u>Bear.</u> You use your action to summon a spirit bear to protect one of your allies. Until the end of your next turn, all attacks against that ally have disadvantage. A successful hit dispels the spirit and this benefit.</p>
<p><u>Eagle.</u> You use your action to summon a spirit eagle that swoops down on a target you can see within 12 squares of you. Roll INT+proficiency vs STR. On success, the target is dragged by the eagle up to 4 squares towards you.</p>
<p><u>Wolf.</u> You use your action to summon a spirit wolf that attacks a target you can see within 6 squares of you. Roll INT+proficiency vs INT. On success, the target loses its next turn fighting off the spirit.</p>
<p><b><i>Spirit Walker.</i></b> Gained at level 10. You can cast the <i>commune with nature</i> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p>
<p><b><i>Totemic Attunement.</i></b> Gained at level 14. You gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
<p><u>Bear.</u> While you're raging, any hostile creature within 1 square of you has disadvantage on attack rolls vs AC against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p>
<p><u>Eagle</u>. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>
<p><u>Wolf.</u> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with a melee weapon attack.</p>
<p><b><i>Totemic Mastery.</i></b> Gained at level 21. You gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
<p><u>Bear.</u> You can wield a shield and a two-handed weapon with no penalty.</p>
<p><u>Eagle.</u> As a master of dual wielding, your sword is your shield. Gain +1 AC while wielding two melee weapons.</p>
<p><u>Wolf.</u> You can use your bonus action to taunt someone into attacking you. When you do so, roll proficiency+CHA against one creature that you can see within 6 squares of you, that can see or hear you. On success, for its next turn it is forced to take no other action than to move towards you or attempt to harm you in some way.</p>

<br/><h4>Path of the Flagellant</h4>
<p>This is not a traditional berserker path, but an invention of the zealots from civilized lands. Eager to show their ultimate devotion to their Deities, these zealots took to hurting themselves with abandon. Heedless of injury to themselves and unafraid of death, the flagellants take pride in the wounds they suffer.</p>
<p><b><i>Death's Door.</i></b> Gained at level 3. You are accustomed to enduring pain and exceptionally difficult to bring down When you drop to 0 hp, roll CON vs 15. On success, regain 1 hp and remain conscious. The DC increases by 1. The DC is reset after you take a long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Strength from Pain.</i></b> Gained at level 6. pain only helps you focus and become stronger. Gain +1 STR for every 24 hp below maximum hp.</p>
<p><b><i>Improved Regeneration.</i></b> Gained at level 10. Your body has grown accustomed to healing injuries. Whenever you gain hit points from any source except Death's Door, gain an extra CON hp.</p>
<p><b><i>Hit Me!</i></b> Gained at level 14. Unlike your allies, you live for the pain. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to shield him with your body and absorb the damage yourself.</p>
<p><b><i>Calculated Risk.</i></b> Gained at level 21. At the start of your turn, you can subtract up to 10 from your AC and add that number to your hit and damage rolls for melee attacks. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>
