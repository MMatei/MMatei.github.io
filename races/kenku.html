<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The Kenku were once Aarakocra sent by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa (from the Elemental Plane) to aid the mortals in vanquishing the cults of Elemental Evil that sought to corrupt the elemental forces and bend them to their will. But they were lured by the God Loki with promises of wealth, brightly colored feathers and the power to fly ever higher. They were given the power to mimic any sound they heard and thus were employed as double-agents to devastating effect, thus turning the tide of the Elemental War against the forces of good. It took quite some time for brave heroes to uncover this treachery. The Dukes of Aaqa then cursed their wayward servants as punishment, turning their feathers pitch black and stripping away the power of flight.</p>
<p>The Kenku are defined by their punishment - some understand it and try to redeem themselves, while others resent it and seek to make the most of their situation by serving dark powers. Naturally, people always assume the latter when dealing with Kenku and will generally be suspicious and wary when dealing with one. Even should a Kenku forge a high place in society for itself, it would then be subject to accusations of having lied and cheated its way into that position; reprisals are unfortunately common.</p>
<p>Because they are nearly universally shunned, Kenku either live in ghettos in large urban centers, or as nomads roaming sparsely populated wildernesses. These nomadic flocks can be quite successful, able to thwart some predators simply through the clever use of their voice. Compared with urban Kenku, their nomadic brethren are far more likely to be selfless and inclined to do good, since they did not have to endure a life of suspicion and abuse.</p>
