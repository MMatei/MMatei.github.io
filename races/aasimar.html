<h1 align="center">Aasimar</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The aasimar (also called high men) are the children of celestials and humans, born with a heightened sense of justice and righteousness. They are very pious, however, and they see law as a matter of faith, not reason, which leads them to be often inflexible in their outlook. Other races often find them to be too rigid and far too eager to view everything in stark, black or white terms. In fact, some aasimar may have shock when forced with the hard and unpleasant choices inherent in life. Many an aasimar has been driven to suicide rather than be forced to compromise his/her beliefs.</p>
<p>Religion is extremely important to the aasimar, and they devote at least an hour every day for prayer and honoring of the Deities. Their settlements are filled with temples to all Deities, grand and small. In fact, aasimar can be even rather superstitious, sicne they are so focused on never upsetting any of the 'good' Deities.</p>
