<h1 align="center">Human</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Humans are the most widespread and diverse race in the world of Neveria, and the most willing to explore, colonize and live alongside other races (and also interbreed with them - humans rarely shy away from breeding!). They live in almost every habitat, which has led to incredible diversity among them, in skin color, eye shape, hair types, and even height. Their unbounded curiosity and ambition has led them to forge countless varied nations, all of whom inevitably crumble within centuries, however, because of human short-sightedness and hubris.</p>
<p>Thanks to their adaptability, humans find it easy to live among different cultures, and human nations have often eagerly embraced different races. But as a race of extremes, humans can sometimes also fall into xenophobia, and conduct vicious single-minded purges of other races (at times even other humans).</p>
<p>Humans are the creation of Darun-Nurad, the God of Balance, who wanted his children to be capable of experiencing the whole gamut of emotions in the world. Their choices would be meaningless, after all, if they weren't equally disposed towards all of them.</p>
