<h1 align="center">Triton</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Durin the Elemental War, many primordial forces were unleashed on the world. Tritons, being guardians and caretakers of the Plane of Water, felt it was their responsability to prevent hostile forces from their Plane from damaging the Material World. Thus, they elected to send volunteers to the Material Plane to engage their ancestral enemies in battle and keep the other sentient races safe.</p>
<p>Tritons are valiant warriors who take their mission very seriously. Although they have also built palaces and works of art for their enjoyment, they are first and foremost a highly militarized society, with every triton expected to serve at least some time in the military.</p>
<p>As a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference. This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons' great victories over dreadful undersea threats that might well have doomed coast-bound nations.</p>
<p>Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others. Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.</p>
<p>At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, or misunderstand what to land-dwellers is common sense, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.</p>
