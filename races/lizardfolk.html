<h1 align="center">Lizardfolk</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Seeing the Dark Age that had descended upon the lands, the Goddess Otana wept. Lizards that drank from these tears gained consciousness and a very strong sense of reason, as well as the ability to stand upright. Very soon, the lizardfolk succeeded in building many beautiful and prosperous city states that would eventually put an end to the Dark Age. While this precursor civilization has long since been destroyed, lizardfolk have always worked hard to build new ones.</p>
<p>Lizardfolk are very uncommon in that they have a very limited emotions, and they tend to be very rational and calculated. This might make them seem cold-blooded (literally!) monstrous to other humanoids, but lizardfolk aren't evil or selfish, they are just very pragmatic and totally devoted to truth and reason. Their lack of empathy may make them seem alien in interactions, but they will rarely, if ever, actively hurt other's feelings - they just don't understand them.</p>
<p>Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants. Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.</p>
<p>A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids will, over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions, however. The lizardfolk doesn't share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.</p>
<p>At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps. Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.</p>
<p>Due to their pragmatism, lizardfolk have little appreciation for art, although they do have great interest (almost bordering on enjoyment) for debates of any kind and for thought problems and philosophy. Lizardfolk revere knowledge in all its forms and they have a religious zeal for truth. No insult is greater to a lizardfolk than to hear a lie; even bening lies that only seek to not hurt another's emotions are shunned by them.</p>
<p>Lizardfolk can master Common, but their mindset results in a speech pattern dissimilar from other humanoids, based on facts an unambiguous statements. Lizardfolk rarely use metaphors or words with several meanings. Their speech is almost always literal. They might pick up idioms, but only with some difficulty. Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive, so they tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words.</p>
<p>Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A lizardfolk in cold weather might say, "This wind brings cold" rather than "I feel cold." Lizardfolk tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.</p>
