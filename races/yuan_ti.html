<h1 align="center">Yuan-Ti Pureblood</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>The Yuan-Ti were once a mighty human civilization, a center of commerce and great learning. Fearful of their mortality and desiring to ascend to the peak of human condition, they turned to the worship of the deceitful serpent God Sseth, who promised them perfection in exchange for blood sacrifices and other sacrilegious rituals of debauchery and cannibalism. Shocked at their depravity, Yuan-Ti's neighbors waged holy wars that threatened to eradicate this once splendid civilization. The Yuan-Ti begged Sseth for salvation, and he offered a path... that turned all his worshippers into various kinds of serpentine abominations; powerful enought to escape their predicament and retreat deep into the jungle, but no longer the beautiful perfect beings they desired to be.</p>
<p>Purebloods are those Yuan-Ti who got off the lightest: snake pupils (but of varying colors), a long forked tongue, a total loss of body hair and the occasional patch of scaly skin. Many among them have forsaken Sseth, but they haven't turned away from evil entirely, as they are still obsessed with their quest for perfection. Scattered in the wilderness, the Yuan-Ti dream of a new civilization of their own, but they are viewed with extreme distrust by all those who know of their history, and thus no new civilization of the Yuan-Ti has yet arisen.</p>
<p>Their ambition for perfection, however, makes them excellent craftsmen at the forefront of innovation. They may not be as reliably good as dwarves, but they are inventive and hungry for success. Especially in luxury goods they are highly regarded.</p>
<p>A pureblood's hair is very smooth and durable, and never the least bit curly, to the point that it is in high demand not only for wigs, but also for high-end ropes. The Yuan-Ti are quite proud of their hair, and they take very great care to maintain it. It is almost a sin among them to cut hair very short, and many purebloods have long manes that stretch almost to the ground. Aristocrats who do not have to drudge through mud and dust usually let their hair grown even longer, with dozens of attendants hired to watch over their precious mane. Yuan-Ti do not lose hair unless gripped by very serious illness, nor does it lose its color and lustre with age.</p>
