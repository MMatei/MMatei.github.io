<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>[History 30] Soon after the Eternal Empire was established, its ruling caste decided that specialized mining slaves were required in order to extract the riches of the earth at an accelerated pace. With dwarves increasingly needed as trusted leaders across the expanding Empire, and with orc and goblin slaves notoriously difficult to manage, there was a serious crisis of good miner manpower. After much magical experimentation, the wizards managed to perfect a procedure that transformed humans into gnomes. Since the differences between the two races were now too great to permit cross-breeding, and since mining was fairly lethal work, the gnomes were engineered to be very fast breeders, with the typical gnomish family having about 10 children.</p>
<p>Due to their slavery in such a bleak environment, gnomes have evolved a peculiar sense of humor, that most races find goes too far. Nothing is sacred to the gnomes, and dark and even blasphemous humour are commonplace. They don't mean any harm by it, and they will stop if it visibly hurts others; it's just that they can't help themselves. Faced with grim situations that might break down others, a gnome simply cracks an inappropriate joke and soldiers on.</p>
<p>Gnomes are considered eccentric, if not outright crazy, by the other races, not only for their weird humor, but also for their brightly colored garments (always in contrasting colors!) and baubles - gnomes absolutely love shining baubles, and gems even more so. Gnomes also have an unhealthy penchant for crazy inventions that are rarely practical and safe, since they are very curious and adventurous, and prone to tinker, almost heedless of their own safety. While they are generally considerate of the lives of others, they aren't as attentive with their own. A gnome is quite likely to jump into peril without a second thought if he thinks he stands to gain something from it.</p>
<p>Gnomes are organized by clans who live tightly together. Clans sometimes join together to form larger cities in areas that are particularly resource rich, but they generally keep separate. Gnomes have a strong sense of loyalty to their clan, which generally translates into benign rivalry with the other clans. Family units are also very close, but carry no name of their own. Due to their explosive population growth and their high mortality rates, gnomes do not bother with personal names. Instead, they simply use a number taken from the clan's central register, alongside the number of their father. Numbers of the deceased are periodically reintroduced to the registrar, which is simply a huge brass cauldron with name tags. In rare situations where the register cannot be consulted, gnomes are usually named after gemstones.</p>
<br/><h4>Traits</h4>
<p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> +1 Intelligence.</p>
<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Gnomes mature very fast, and they are considered adults at the age of 12. Technically, a gnome can live as long as 120 years, but their adventurous ways (which do not dull in old age) ensure that only very few reach such a prodigious age.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Gnomes are generally chaotic, but only very rarely are they selfish. They try to do good, but sometimes their eccentric nature gets in the way of their best efforts.</p>
<p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Gnomes are 0.9 and 1.2 meters tall and average about 20-30 kg (they have wiry frames that are nonetheless surprisingly strong). Their size is Small.</p>
<p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 5 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares (18m) of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><b><i>Gnome Cunning.</i></b> Magic attacks against your Warding, Intuition, or Will are rolled with disadvantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. Gnomish is a soft dialect of Dwarvish, constructed out of the inability of Gnomes to pronounce harsh consonants (eg. the Dwarvish for city - khaz - is pronounced cas). Gnomes frequently shorten and unite words and have a tendency to speak fast.</p>

<br/>
<h4>Shallow Gnome (Scotes)</h4>
<p>These are the gnome clans that live near the surface and often trade with outsiders. They are master tinkers and eager adventurers.</p>
<p><b><i>Tinker.</i></b> You gain proficiency in Mechanics. You also know how to build intricate, if not terribly useful, mechanical contraptions, such as mechanical toys, fire starters or music boxes.</p>
<p><b><i>Artificer's Lore.</i></b> Whenever you make a History check related to alchemy or mechanical devices, your proficiency bonus is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Speak with Small Beasts.</i></b> Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. The scotes love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, cats, and other creatures as beloved pets.</p>

<h4>Deep Gnome (Pictes)</h4>
<p>Adventurous as they are, and resentful of their slavery, quite a large number of gnomes escaped to the depths of the Underdark, where they built new cities and formed a free civilization. These gnomes are not much different in behavior to their cousins closer to the surface, but the environment has left its mark on their appearance. Their skin is gray, and their hair has lost most of its color and lustre. In fact, pictes males are completely bald, and can grow only the most meagre of moustaches. The deep gnomes try to compensate this with bejeweled clothing and golden piercings, and they value colored cloth from above very highly.</p>
<p><b><i>Superior Darkvision.</i></b> Your darkvision has a radius of 24 squares (36m).</p>
<p><b><i>Stone Camouflage.</i></b> So long as you aren't wearing any particularly distinctive clothing, you have advantage on Stealth checks made when hiding against stone of any kind, whether rocky outcroppings or intricate masonry.</p>
<p><b><i>Deep Gnome Magic.</i></b> When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/nondetection.html">nondetection</a> spell once per day, without requiring the use of any material components.</p>
