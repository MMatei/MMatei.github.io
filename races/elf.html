<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>[History 30] A very long time ago, when writing has barely been invented, a band of human rebels took refuge in the vast woodlands of Ythrondir. Continuously threatened by the overwhelming might of the Eternal Empire, their mages scoured the Inner Realms for help. They forged an alliance with the Seelie Fey, sealed by magic and inter-marriage, which tipped the scales of the conflict and led to the defeat of the Empire. The children of these rebels became the Elves of today.</p>
<p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>
<p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have unmatched patience and they have been known to retreat from intrusions, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>
<p>Owing to their fey ancestry, the elves have a chaotic bent. They appreciate freedom more than most and they are strong-willed and stubborn. They are rarely selfish, but they can be quite arrogant and especially self-righteous. They believe that their ancient and distinguished civilization is greater than anyone else's, and they take pride in their nations, that have withstood the vagaries of time much better than most. While they are right to be proud of their many achievements, they can come off as too patronizing at times.</p>
<p>Elves grow no hair on their bodies except for their head. In exchange, however, they do not suffer from baldness (except from magical causes). Elven hair is famously soft and strong and is highly sought after for luxurious wigs or resistant ropes.</p>
<br/><h4>Traits</h4>
<p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> +1 Dexterity.</p>
<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically c1aims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than evil. The drow are an exception; they lean more towards selfishness and evil.</p>
<p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Elves range from under 1.6 to over 1.9 meters tall and have slender builds. They weigh 60-80 kg. Their size is Medium.</p>
<p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Keen Senses.</i></b> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
<p><b><i>Fey Ancestry.</i></b> Attacks that would charm you are rolled with disadvantage, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
<p><b><i>Trance.</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

<br/><h4>High Elf (Aldfae)</h4>
<p>They are the original elves, and they take inordinate pride in that. They live in beautiful cities that blend tall spires, green spaces and artificial waterfalls. These cities are situated next to natural concentration points of the Weave, where arcane energy is at its strongest. This, alongside their direct Fey ancestry, gives high elves a strong affinity to magic. High elves love knowledge, as well as the pursuit of arts, and their cities boast numerous and well-stocked libraries and art collections.</p>
<p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> +1 Intelligence.</p>
<p><b><i>Cantrip.</i></b> You know one Cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Your spellpower for this cantrip equals Intelligence + proficiency bonus.</p>
<p><b><i>Fine Education.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>

<h4>Wood Elf (Silfae)</h4>
<p>[History 28] The elven nation of Ythrondir collapsed in a very long and deadly series of calamities and wars that saw the nation's leadership become increasingly authoritarian in order to help stem the disasters. Disgruntled by what they saw as a betrayal of elven values and wearied of fighting in an apparently never-ending conflict, a group of elves fled the beleaguered nation, the first to do so until then. This group found a different forest to settle, where they decided they would live more in tune with nature and more faithful to their origins.</p>
<p>Wood elves are very fond of nature and of their freedom. They always elect their rulers and are extremely suspicious of any attempt at centralization of power. They are also not very fond of others intruding in their forests, and can quickly become aggressive if the intruders do not show proper respect to nature.</p>

<p><b><i>Duskvision.</i></b> Accustomed to the shade of deep forests and of twilight, you have superior vision in dim lighting. You can see in dim light within 12 squares (18m) of you as if it were bright light.</p>
<p><b><i>Fleet of Foot.</i></b> Your base walking speed increases to 7 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Mask of the Wild.</i></b> You can attempt to hide from sight even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<p><b><i>Light of Foot.</i></b> +1 Stealth.</p>

<h4>Dark Elf (Drow)</h4>
<p>[History 28] The drow are also refugees from the destroyed first elven nation of Ythrondir, but their anabasis took a far darker turn than that of the wood elves. Hounded by enemies, they only found refuge deep in the caverns of the Underdark, where they had to kill and steal in order to eke out a living. They became cruel, obsessed with pain both in themselves and in others, and they turned to the worship of Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. She spins many foul plots that the drow feel compelled to further in order to remain in her favor. While not all drow revel in the evil Lolth compels them to do, few see any alternative.</p>
<p>Completely pale and thinner than other elves, drow have a fierce fighting spirit and tremendous will, prerequisites for surviving in such a harsh environment. They learn from a young age to endure pain and triumph in spite of it. Many even find relish in pain, whether it is inflicted upon others, or even upon themselves, in order to increase focus.</p>
<p>Drow society centers around a matriarchal priestly caste, that is also divided into several Bloodlines. These families vie with each other for power, and seldom refrain from using violence if it would bring an advantage. It is only the will of Lolth and a desire for survival that keeps these bloodlines from all-out warfare - feuds are carefully regulated, and reckless, open violence is frowned upon.</p>
<p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow - either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a bloodline.</p>
<p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.</p>
<p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> +1 Charisma.</p>
<p><b><i>Superior Darkvision.</i></b> Accustomed to dark caverns, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

<p><b><i>Sunlight Sensitivity.</i></b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls vs Deflection and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</i>

You don't need material components for these spells, but you can't cast them in direct sunlight.</p>
<p><b><i>Dark Elf Weapon Training.</i></b> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</p>
