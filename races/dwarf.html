<h1 align="center">Dwarf</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. This longevity makes them rather conservative, slow to trust and to forget grudges, and stubborn in their pursuit of a goal.</p>
<p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect lhe traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly.</p>
<p>Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>
<p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
