<h1 align="center">Dwarf</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Dwarves generally live for about 200 years, but a privileged few can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. The oldest of the dwarves sit on the highest councils, and they are seen to be the wisest among their kind, which leads to a very conservative society. In fact, no new idea is adopted by the dwarves until it has been proven effective for at least a century. Furthermore, the older something is, the higher the regard in which it is held. Ancient artifacts will always be seen as superior to even the finest crafts of the day. This can sometimes lead dwarves to a pesimistic outlook, thinking that the best times are behind them.</p>
<p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They are highly devoted to the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world. Much of a dwarf's life, in fact, is defined by tradition, and to stray from it is an egregious sin against the Gods. Part of those traditions is intense devotion to Ammun, God of law and civilization, as well as to Donar, dwarven God of smelting, and Freyya, dwarven Goddess of ale, all things very dear to the dwarven heart.</p>
<p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud that stretches for entire centuries. Dwarves hold grudges, and even apparently minor insults can be cause for a decades-lasting grudge.</p>
<p>Dwarves are very fond of wealth, sometimes to the point of outright greed. They will rarely countenance immoral actions to increase their wealth, but they will work themselves dead in order to build up their personal fortune. They will spend freely to help valued friends and family, of course, but dwarves are generally stingy if it can at all be helped. Securing wealth is seen as the primary way of building one's legacy, and the great dwarven families have huge vaults with intricate defenses where they hoard centuries' worth of treasures. This fact makes dwarven cities a particularly tempting target for all manner of invaders. This also makes dwarves obsessed with self-sufficiency and efficiency in their cities. They are very pleased with selling their products, but they are loathe to have to buy anything in return.</p>
<p>Dwarven craftsmen organize in Guilds that are extremely protective of their trade secrets. The workshops of the Guilds are generally closed even to trusted allies, for the dwarves prize their craftsmanship above all else. In fact, excellence in crafts is a point of pride for all Guilds, and they always strive to be renowned as the best in the world.</p>
<p>Dwarves do not feel comfortable without the solid earth under their feet. They are fairly adverse to sailing, and so all sea or river trade with dwarven holds is handled by other races. But if a few adventurous dwarves may brave the open seas, flying is completely out of the question, as is travel through the formless Astral or Ethereal planes. Not even in riding, or as passengers in a cart, are dwarves very comfortable - they prefer to walk.</p>
<p>A dwarf's name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf's name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>
<br/><h4>Traits</h4>
<p><b><i>Attribute Increase.</i></b> +1 Constitution.</p>
<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p>
<p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Dwarves stand between 1.2 and 1.5 meters tall, but are stocky, with powerful muscles, thus averaging about 70-90 kg (equivalent to the taller humans). Their size is Medium.</p>
<p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 5 squares. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares (18m) of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><b><i>Dwarven Resilience.</i></b> Poison attacks against you are rolled with disadvantage, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Dwarven Combat Training.</i></b> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and warhammer.</p>
<p><b><i>Practiced Craftsman.</i></b> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Crafting (Smithing), Crafting (Jewelry), Crafting (Brewing), Crafting (Masonry).</p>
<p><b><i>Stonecunning.</i></b> Whenever you make an active Perception check related to masonry, you are considered to be proficient in Perception. If you are already proficient, double your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p>

<br/>
<h4>Mountain Dwarf (Bergenar)</h4>
<p>Bergenar live most, if not their entire lives deep underground in cylindrical cities dug deep in the bowels of ore-rich mountains. Unsurprisingly, they are among the best miners and masons in the whole world. They are curiously suspicious of magic and of foreign Deities - but this should come as little surprise - they are generally suspicious of anything foreign to them, moreso than any other dwarf cultures. Mining is an unofficial rite of passage for bergenar, even girls, and so you are unlikely to find a mountain dwarf unable to split rock open with an exper swing of a pick.</p>
<p><b><i>Attribute Increase.</i></b> +1 Strength.</p>

<h4>Hill Dwarf (Geldar)</h4>
<p>Hill dwarves live in shallower settlements than mountain dwarves and venture to the surface more often, on occasions even going so far as to settle in the cities of other races. They are more exposed to danger than their cousins and so they have adapted a keen sense of hearing and a hardy constitution.</p>
<p><b><i>Keen Hearing.</i></b> Advantage on Perception checks primarily based on hearing. +1 to Passive Perception.</p>
<p><b><i>Dwarven Toughness.</i></b> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>

<h4>Grey Dwarf (Duergar)</h4>
<p>The duergar were once mountain dwarves of the fabled city of Zhur. Their greed, fueled by their God Ladugar, led to endless delving beneath the earth, which eventually brought them into contact with the mind flayers, who gradually seized control of the entire city. The dwarves of Zhur closed their gates to the outside and became mere slaves to the cruel illithids. The dwarves suffered captivity for generations, and they were spread throughout the Underdark, forced into hard labor for their masters. Eventually, however, Ladugar returned to save his followers, and the dwarves waged a successful war against the illithids. They are far from independent, however, for they have merely exchanged one cruel master for another.</p>
<p>Ladugar does not often enforce his will openly, but he makes certain that the duergar remember their eternal debt to him. He sometimes comes to collect on that debt, forcing the duergar into furthering his own selfish schemes to become the foremost dwarven God. Most grey dwarves, however, have come to relish their role as foot soldiers of Ladugar. The race as a whole retains little of the good ways of their dwarven ancestors, although they still have a rigid commitment to order. In fact, the gray dwarves are almost fanatical in their commitment to efficiency. This sometimes bends the usual dwarven reluctance for the new, and duergar are by far the most innovative of their race.</p>
<p>The grey dwarves are frugal in their dress, although the upper classes do make their status evident with exquisitely groomed beards and fine jewelry. They are hard working and have no patience for laziness, but they are not above enslaving others to do the heavy lifting. Their skin is grayish pale, their irises have no pigment and so appear red, and their hair is gray or white. No hair grows on their heads, so the grey dwarves usually place very ornate tattoos their heads, sometimes even laced with gold. They also groom their beards with great care - so much so that it is a very important sign of status. To insult or damage a grey dwarf's beard is to make a permanent enemy out of him.</p>
<p><b><i>Superior Darkvision.</i></b> Your darkvision has a radius of 24 squares (36m).</p>
<p><b><i>Sunlight Sensitivity.</i></b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls vs Deflection and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive, is in direct sunlight.</p>
<p><b><i>Grey Dwarf Magic.</i></b> When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/enlarge.html">enlarge</a> spell once per day, but you can only use the enlarge option. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/invisibility.html">invisibility</a> spell once per day. Your spellpower for this type of innate magic is Charisma + proficiency bonus. You don't need material components for these spells, but you can't cast them in direct sunlight.</p>
<p><b><i>Mental Resilience.</i></b> Illusions have disadvantage on rolls against you. Attacks that would charm or paralyze you are made with disadvantage. +1 Warding.</p>
