<h1 align="center">Halfling</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>[History 30] With the resounding success of gnomes as mining slaves, the rulers of the Eternal Empire soon decided that it would be very much worth it to engineer a docile race especially for agricultural production. The result of this effort was halflings. Even after the Empire fell, and thousands of years elapsed, not all halflings were released from their servitude, for the humans appreciated the great financial advantages these slaves presented.</p>
<p>Halflings are optimistic creatures, who try to make the best of their circumstances. They are very kind-hearted and emotional, prone to great bursts of joy or tears. They are very pacifistic, as it is against their very being to hurt another living being. Back them into a corner, however, and halflings can demonstrate great bravery and camaraderie. They are the least adventurous of all races, prefering the comforts of hearth and home to the unknowns of the road.</p>
<p>Halflings like living in rural settings and few move on to cities. They can make very good traders, however, for they are thrifty and good stewards, and those halflings adventurous enough to travel have amassed great wealth from commerce. Halflings don't like to expose their wealth, however, not only because they are content with simple things, but also because they are loathe to attract unwanted attention. Halflings want to blend in with the other races in their communities, and they try to attract as little attention as possible.</p>
<p>While there are regions populated solely by halflings, they have no political entities of their own. Halflings have almost zero interest in politics or power and prefer to let others rule over them. It is indeed very hard to get a halfling population to revolt, at least as long as their food supply is not threatened - halflings are very fond of their meals.</p>
