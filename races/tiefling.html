<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>[History 26] At the end of the Second Age, there was a massive invasion of devils, facilitated by a depraved cult dedicated to Asmodeus. The Devil Lord gave them his twisted blessing, infusing them with fiendish blood which granted them considerable advantages. This 'blessing' was also forcibly visited upon many who found themselves in the hands of the devils, and many women were forcibly raped. Most of them were culled as the invasion was beaten back, but some scattered stragglers managed to survive in the wilds or were accepted by merciful souls. With the world beset by countless other troubles in the immediate aftermath of the invasion, the tieflings were begrudgingly accepted into human society, though they never were more than tolerated.</p>
<p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's, and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They have thick tails, up to 1.5m long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors-black, red, white, silver, or gold-with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple. Aside from their distinctive marks of devilish heritage, which can be repugnant to some, tieflings are renowned for their beauty and smooth skin.</p>
<p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with slightly more respect. People are naturally suspicious of them because of their heritage and, especially in places where tieflings are unheard of, they are often times lynched on sight.</p>
<p>Lacking a homeland, tieftings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling's companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefting learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>
<p>Tieflings retain most of the human versatility and adaptability, but they are noticeably more strong-willed (sometimes verging on stubborn) and, of course, they also have access to a few fiendish special powers.</p>
