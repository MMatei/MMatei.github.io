<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Created during the heyday of the Mydasian Empire as novelties for an increasingly decadent population, the Tigrans spent much of their history as slaves. Only in the chaos of the Empire's collapse did some of them manage to achieve freedom, living as nomadic tribes as far from civilization as they can.</p>
<p>Tigrans are very graceful creatures, with beautiful tiger-like faces and brightly colored eyes. Their fur can have any of a wide variety of luxuriant colors: white, blonde, scarlet, brown or even black. Tigrans are very proud of their appearance and take great effort to maintain it, often to the point of vanity. They even tend to choose mates of the same fur color, so that their children inherit monochrome furs. Mixed marriages don't always produce children with shaggy fur, but when they do, those children are often an object of undue ridicule.</p>
<p>Like most felines, Tigrans are also endowed with surprising agility and an enhanced climbing ability, which they employ for maximum effect as they wander the lands. They like to roam around harsh terrain with steep rocks and plentiful forests, where their enemies would have a harder time at catching up with them. At the same time, though, tigrans have a preference for warmer climates, and quite a significant number has migrated to the jungles of Trax.</p>
<p>Tigrans are absolutely fascinated by jewelry and they prize it extremely highly, often adorning themselves with as many as they can afford. Tigran fashion in fact, is highly oriented towards beauty over practicality, especially for those lucky enough to live in cities. But even the nomadic Tigrans enjoy dressing richly when not on a hunt, and they always build a semi-permanent village where they periodically meet with other tribes to trade, celebrate and mingle.</p>
<p>Tigrans are curious, but also capricious. They may move mountains in pursuit of something that strikes their fancy, but as soon as they acquire it, the object loses all value and may even end up carelessly thrown away. The thrill of the hunt captivates a Tigran above all else.</p>
<p>Tigrans acquire vices more easily than most and are liable to pursue them with abandon. They crave pleasure and will do their best to acquire and prolong it.</p>
