<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>[History 28] Faced with extinction during the 2nd Age, dragons pooled together their magical powers in order to create a race of faster-breeding beings that could protect them. This work could not have been completed without the willing participation of human cultists, who underwent the transformation to the first dragonborn. Together with the lesser kobolds, the dragonborn armies managed to turn the tide of the war and protect the dragons from extinction. Eventually, a peace with honor was signed between the good-aligned dragonkind and the other mortal races.</p>
<p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, and clans that have stayed pure still do, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance for most dragonborn. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, considerably larger than humans. Their hands and feet are strong, talon-like claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>
<p>Dragonborn are organized in broods led by a matriarch. This matriarch is often a female ancient dragon the brood lives to serve and protect, but if there is none, then the wisest female of the brood takes this role. To any dragonborn, their brood is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their brood above all else, even the Deities. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her brood, and bringing dishonor to the brood will result in expulsion and exile. However, unlike in other clan-based societies, the blood relatives of the exile are not dishonored by his actions. The brood as whole bears the collective shame and seeks to atone for it. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the brood, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>
<p>Broods without a dragon to guard are most often nomadic, for the dragonborn carry a wanderlust in their bones that stems from their winged ancestors. Even members of a settled tribe will often set on lengthy travels to discover more, and perhaps perfect their chosen profession on the way. Unlike their makers, dragonborn have little interest in treasure, and they prefer to donate it to their matriarch, or to invest it in the pursuit of their chosen profession. Dragonborn do have a keen eye and appreciation for the arts, however.</p>
<p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They know their life is short, and they want to honor it by achieving perfection. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p>
<p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is another dragonborn brood. Help will always be sought from kin first and foremost, and only in the last extremity do dragonborn seek outside help. This burning pride sometimes even leads them to reject help from foreigners, but they are always very grateful and generous to their allies.</p>
