<h1 align="center">Half-Orc</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Ashur is a fickle God, and he has corrupted humans many times in search of the perfect warrior race. Orcs were his first and, some sages argue, his most successful attempt. Driven by an unsatiable bloodlust but intelligent enough to understand strategy and form strong hordes, orcs have long plagued the civilizations of Neveria.</p>
<p>But humans and orcs aren't always at war. Savage barbarian tribes sometimes make alliances with the orcs, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p>
<p>Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. This makes them not exactly welcome in most human societies, as they are often a reminder of terrible atrocities visited upon them by orcs. While most humans are probably too intimidated to make their hatred known, they will nonetheless be unpleasant and uncooperative.</p>
<p>Beauty to half-orcs is about battle scars, strength and height, and they pay little attention to ornamentation, save that useful for combat. A good cleaver is far more attractive to them than a bejeweled scepter, and a sturdy plate is more prized than a comfortable velour robe.</p>
<p>Half-orcs feel emotion very strongly. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures - feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing - fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.</p>

<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p>
<p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 1.7 to well over 1.9 meters tall. They weigh between 90-110 kg. Their size is Medium.</p>
<p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 6 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Menacing.</i></b> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
<p><b><i>Relentless Endurance.</i></b> Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 hp without dying outright, you drop to 1 hp instead and do not suffer the normal effects of reaching 0 hp.</p>
<p><b><i>Savage Attacks.</i></b> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, add the weapon's base damage as raw damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Aggressive.</i></b> As a quick action, you can move up to your speed toward a hostile creature that you can see.</p>
<p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own, and in the rare instances when it is written, it uses the Dwarvish script.</p>
