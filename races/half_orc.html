<h1 align="center">Half-Orc</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlord or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p>
<p>Half-orcs' grayish pigmenlation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and lowering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. They regard battle sears as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty.</p>

<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p>
