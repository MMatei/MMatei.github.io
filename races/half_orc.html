<h1 align="center">Half-Orc</h1>
<h4>Lore</h4>
<p>Ashur is a fickle God, and he has corrupted humans many times in search of the perfect warrior race. Orcs were his first and, some sages argue, his most successful attempt. Driven by an unsatiable bloodlust but intelligent enough to understand strategy and form strong hordes, orcs have long plagued the civilizations of Neveria.</p>
<p>But humans and orcs aren't always at war. Savage barbarian tribes sometimes make alliances with the orcs, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p>
<p>Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. They regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty.</p>
<p>Half-orcs feel emotion very strongly. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures - feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing - fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.</p>

<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p>
<p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 1.7 to well over 1.9 meters tall. They weigh between 90-110 kg. Their size is Medium.</p>
