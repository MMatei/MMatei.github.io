Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 6-square radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a> for 10 rounds. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br/>
A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.<br/>
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
