<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You establish a telepathic link with one beast you touch that is friendly to you or charmed by you. The spell fails if the beast's Intelligence modifier is -1 or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 1 square of you that you can see.<br/>
If the creature had been charmed when this spell was cast, the creature remains charmed for the entire duration of the spell.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level, the link remains active even if the line of sight is lost, so long as no more than 100m separate you. Furthermore, the maximum duration of the spell increases to 30 minutes.<br/>
