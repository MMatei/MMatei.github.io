<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/encha.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl1">Level I</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=encha">Noumancy</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=range">Ranger</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A beast you touch, friendly to, or charmed by, you<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You establish a telepathic link with the target. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate to the best of its possibilities (simple emotions and clear, physical concepts). While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 1 square of you that you can see.<br/>
If the creature had been charmed when this spell was cast, the creature remains charmed for the entire duration of the spell.<br/>
Beasts in the wild are generally wary of strangers, but can be befriended with small offerings of food so long as the stranger seems not to pose any threat to them. If a beast allows you to touch it, then it is considered friendly towards you.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the link remains active even if the line of sight is lost, so long as no more than 100m separate you. Furthermore, the maximum duration of the spell increases to 30 minutes.<br/>
