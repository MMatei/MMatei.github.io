<b><i>Target:</i></b> Self<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You contact your patron Deity or a Deity closely aligned with it and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The answers you receive are correct to the best of the Deity's knowledge, but one should keep in mind that not even the Deities are omniscient.<br/>
You might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the Deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the Deityâ€™s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.<br/>
If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that the spell is wasted.
