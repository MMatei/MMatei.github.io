<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> Specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gg<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Self<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from your patron Deity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:
<ul>
    <li>Weal, for good results</li>
    <li>Woe, for bad results</li>
    <li>Weal and woe, for mixed results (a reward with a consequence)</li>
    <li>Unclear, for results that aren't especially good or bad, or whose outcome is too uncertain</li>
</ul>
The spell cannot take into account the vagaries of fate; it will only report on the most likely outcome. For example, if there is treasure on the other side of a chasm and you ask whether you should brave the jump, the answer will be weal if you have reasonably good chances of surviving the jump, unclear if the outcome is around 50-50, and woe if you are unlikely to survive.<br/>
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.<br/>
