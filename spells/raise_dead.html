<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/necro.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl5">Level V</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=necro">Animancy</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=palad">Paladin</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 hour<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> An emerald worth at least 500 gg, which the spell consumes<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A dead creature dead for no longer than 10 days, within 6 squares<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> If the target's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hp.<br/>
This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.<br/>
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival – its head, for instance – the spell automatically fails.<br/>
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all rolls it makes and to all its defenses except Deflection. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
