<b><i>Effect.</i></b> As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 1 square of it. The second creature takes <span class="fire">2d6 fire damage</span>.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> This spell's damage is 4d6 for a caster of level 5, 6d6 for a caster of level 11, 8d6 for a caster of level 17 and 10d6 for a caster of level 23.<br/><br/>

<i>You coat your weapon with the green fire used by witches of the bog. Witchfire is a fickle force, far more dangerous than its counterpart, as it can burn through many materials otherwise resistant to fire. When your weapon strikes true, the witchfire coils and seeks another target for its ire, never content to simply do its master's bidding. It is a capricious spell, but its superior power cannot be denied.</i>
