Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 4-square cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage and becomes prone on a failed save, or it takes half damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each square of the area requires at least 10 rounds to clear by hand.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 2nd.
