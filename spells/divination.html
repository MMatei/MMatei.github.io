<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> Self<br/>
<b><i>Components:</i></b> V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/><br/>
Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a Deity or a Deityâ€™s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.<br/>
The spell cannot take into account unknown variables that might change the outcome. In particular, the DM has no control or foresight of the actions the players take; he can only speculate on the future, assuming a most likely chain of events.<br/>
If you cast this spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
