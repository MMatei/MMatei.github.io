<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 6 squares long, 3m high, and 1m thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 4 squares in diameter, 3m high, and 1m thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.<br/>
Any ranged weapon attack that passes through the wall has disadvantage on the attack roll, and gases and fire attacks cannot pass through the wall. Spells that deal cold damage cause the area of the wall they touch to freeze solid (at least one square is frozen) and they can't pass through the wall. Each 1 square frozen section has Deflection 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it.<br/>
Losing concentration or the spell duration ending doesn't shatter sections of the wall turned to ice.
