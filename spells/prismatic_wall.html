<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/abjur.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl9">Level IX</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=abjur">Abjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall up to 18 squares (27m) long, 9m high, and 7cm thick centered on a point you can seewithin range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 6 squares (9m) in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.<br/>
The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 20 squares (30m) and dim light for an additional 20 squares. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 4 squares of it or starts its turn there, you roll spellpower vs CON against it. On hit, it is <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a> for 10 rounds.<br/>
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, you roll spellpower vs DEX to affect the creature with that layer's properties as described below.<br/>
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A <i>rod of cancellation</i> destroys a prismatic wall, but an <a href="antimagic_field.html">antimagic field</a> has no effect on it.<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Red. The creature takes <span class="fire">10d6 fire damage</span> on hit, or half as much damage on a miss. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least <span class="cold">25 cold damage</span> to it.</li>
  <li>Orange. The creature takes <span class="acid">10d6 acid damage</span> on hit, or half as much damage on a miss. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>
  <li>Yellow. The creature takes <span class="elec">10d6 electric damage</span> on hit, or half as much damage on a miss. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least <span class="forc">60 force damage</span> to it.</li>
  <li>Green. The creature takes <span class="pois">10d6 poison damage</span> on hit, or half as much damage on a miss. A <a href="passwall.html">passwall</a> spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>
  <li>Blue. The creature takes <span class="cold">10d6 cold damage</span> on hit, or half as much damage on a miss. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least <span class="fire">25 fire damage</span> to it.</li>
  <li>Indigo. On hit, the creature is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a>. At the end of each of its turns, roll spellpower vs CON. If you successfully hit three times, the creature permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the <a href="../conditions/petrified.html">petrified</a> condition. If you miss three times, then the spell ends. The hits and misses don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a <a href="daylight.html">daylight</a> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>
  <li>Violet. On hit, the creature is <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a>. At the start of your next turn, roll spellpower vs MEM. On miss, the blindness ends. On hit, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a <a href="dispel_magic.html">dispel magic</a> spell or similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.</li>
