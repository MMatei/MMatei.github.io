<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 1 square and a height of up to 9m. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has Deflection 5 and 30 hp. When reduced to 0 hp, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 2-square radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.<br/>
If a pillar is created under a creature, roll spellpower vs Reflex. On hit, the creature is lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to be hit.<br/>
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes <span class="crsh">6d6 crushing damage</span> and is <a href="../conditions.restrained.html">restrained</a>, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check vs 8 + spellpower. The restrained creature can also use its action to make an Escape Artist (must be proficient) check vs 6 + spellpower. On a success, the target is freed and it falls off the pillar.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.
