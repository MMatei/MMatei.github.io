<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>

<b><i>Components:</i></b> S<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/><br/>
You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 1 square and a height of up to 9m. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hp. When reduced to 0 hp, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 2-square radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.<br/>
If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.<br/>
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 crushing damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the spell’s saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.
