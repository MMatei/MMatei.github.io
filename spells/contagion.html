<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 7 days<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature within 1 square (1.5m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Deflection. On hit, you afflict the target with one of the following diseases:
<ul>
  <li><u>Blinding Sickness.</u> Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature is <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a>, has disadvantage on Wisdom checks, and attacks against its Intuition are rolled with advantage.</li>
  <li><u>Filth Fever.</u> A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and attack rolls that use Strength, and attacks against its Firmness are rolled with advantage.</li>
  <li><u>Flesh Rot.</u> The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.</li>
  <li><u>Mindfire.</u> The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, attacks against its Warding are rolled with advantage, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the <a href="confusion.html">confusion</a> spell during combat.</li>
  <li><u>Seizure.</u> The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and attack rolls that use Dexterity, and attacks against its Reflex have advantage.</li>
  <li><u>Slimy Doom.</u> The creature's skin turns slimy and begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and attacks against its Endurance have advantage. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is <a href="../conditions/stunned.html">stunned</a> with pain until the end of its next turn.</li>
</ul>
At the end of each of the target’s turns, roll spellpower vs Endurance. After three hits, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and you stop making these rolls. After three misses, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.<br/>
Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.<br/>
