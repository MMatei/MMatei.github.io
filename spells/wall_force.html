An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 2 squares, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 3-by-3 meter panels. Each panel must be continguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 2mm thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).<br/>
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A <a href="disintegrate.html">disintegrate</a> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
