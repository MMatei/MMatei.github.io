You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
  <li>Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
  <li>Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
  <li>Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
</ul>
The summoned creatures disappear when they drop to 0 hp or when the spell ends. They are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level.
