Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 6-square radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 1-square radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution save or be <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a> until the spell ends.
