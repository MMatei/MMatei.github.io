<b><i>Effect.</i></b> By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat". You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 80km per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 40km for other animals.<br/>
When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesnâ€™t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast is free to go about its bussiness.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.
