<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 4-square cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal sonic damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).<br/>
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.<br/>
Roll spellpower to determine the quality of your illusion. Any creature with Passive Perception equal or greater than the quality of the illusion will disbelieve it. If a creature has reason to be suspicious it may actively investigate the illusion with a Wisdom (Perception) roll that, if equal or greater than the quality of the illusion, will lead the creature to disbelieve it. Physical interaction with the image immediately reveals it to be an illusion, because it is immaterial.<br/>
Once a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.<br/>
