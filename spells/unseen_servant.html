<b><i>Effect:</i></b> This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has Deflection 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of -4, and it canâ€™t attack. If it drops to 0 hp, the spell ends.<br/>
Once on each of your turns as a quick action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 3 squares and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.<br/>
If the servant is more than 12 squares (18m) away from you, the spell ends.<br/>
