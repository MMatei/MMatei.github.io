<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 8 hours<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> An agate worth at least 1,000 gg, which the spell consumes<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A Huge or smaller beast or plant that is <a href="../rules.html#creature_intel">mindless or has instinctive intelligence</a> within 1 square (1.5m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch the target and it gains an Intelligence of +0. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.<br/>
The awakened beast or plant is <a href="../spells/charmed.html">charmed</a> by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.<br/><br/>

<i>Druids argue that this spell is proof that the Deities did not create sentient life and that they are mere constructs of faith. Clerics vehemently deny any such argument, and some even view this spell as an affront to the Divine order.</i>
