<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=warlo">Warlock</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> A focus worth at least 1,000 gg, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature you know of that is on the same plane of existence as you<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Warding, with the roll modified by the following factors:<br/>
<table>
<tr><th>Knowledge</th><th>Roll Bonus</th></tr>
<tr><td>Secondhand (you have heard of the target)</td><td>-5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Firsthand (you have met the target)</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Familiar (you know the target well)</td><td>+5</td></tr>
</table>

<tr><th>Connection</th><th>Roll Bonus</th></tr>
<tr><td>Likeness or picture</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Posession or garment</td><td>+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Body part, lock of hair, or similar</td><td>+10</td></tr>
</table>
On miss, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On hit, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 2 squares of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 2 squares of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.<br/>
Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.
