You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.<br/>

<tr><td>Firsthand (you have met the target)</td><td>+0</td></tr>

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 2 squares of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 2 squares of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.<br/>
Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.
