You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 12 squares long and 6m high, or a ringed wall up to 4 squares in diameter, 6m high. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.<br/>
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.<br/>
One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 2 squares of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn. The other side of the wall deals no damage.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
