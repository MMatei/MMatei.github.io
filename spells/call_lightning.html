<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/proto.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl3">Level III</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=proto">Protomancy</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Material Components.</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 3m tall with a 12-square radius, centered on a point you can see 30m directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).<br/>
When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Roll spellpower vs Reflex against every creature within 1 square of that point. On hit, a creature takes <span class="elec">3d10 lightning damage</span>, or half as much damage on a failure. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.<br/>
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
