<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 6 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> Sight<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 60 squares (90m) long, 90m high, and 15m thick. The wall lasts for the duration.<br/>
When the wall appears, roll spellpower vs Firmness against creatures in its area. On hit, deal <span class="crsh">6d10 crushing damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.<br/>
At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 10 squares away from you. Roll spellpower vs Firmness against any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves. On hit, deal <span class="crsh">6d10 crushing damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 15m, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0m in height, the spell ends.<br/>
A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Athletics check against 8 + spellpower in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it canâ€™t move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.
