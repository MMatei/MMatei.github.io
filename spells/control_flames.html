<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A square within 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Choose one of the following:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>You instantaneously create a roaring flame in one square, provided that suitable fuel is present there (it doesn't have to be particularly flammable, but it needs to burn once set on fire). If a creature is present there, roll spellpower vs Reflex. On hit, deal <span class="fire">1d12 fire damage</span> and the creature is <a href="../conditions/on_fire.html">set on fire</a>.</li>
    <li>You instantaneously extinguish all non-magical fires within a 1.5m cube.</li>
    <li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by a non-magical flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>You cause simple shapes (such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location) to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.<br/>
