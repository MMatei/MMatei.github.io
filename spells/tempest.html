A 4-square-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength save or take 2d6 crushing damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.<br/>
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 12 squares of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.<br/>
Creatures within 6 squares of the sphere have disadvantage on Perception checks made to listen.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the lightning damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
