<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> All creatures in a line 12 squares long and 2 squares wide starting from your position<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Firmness against any creature that starts its turn in the target area. On hit, it is pushed 4 squares away from you in a direction following the line.<br/>
Any creature in the line must spend an additional square of movement for every square it moves in your direction. Conversely, it can choose to move 2 squares for every square moved away from you.<br/>
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.<br/>
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
