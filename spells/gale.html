A line of strong wind 12 squares long and 2 squares blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spellâ€™s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength save or be pushed 3 squares away from you in a direction following the line.<br/>
Any creature in the line must spend 2 squares of movement for every squares it moves when moving closer to you. Conversely, it can choose to move 2 squares for every square moved away from you.<br/>
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.<br/>
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
