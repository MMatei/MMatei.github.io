<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/><br/>
Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 4-square area on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.<br/>
When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 3d6 crushing damage and be <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 crushing damage.<br/>
A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
