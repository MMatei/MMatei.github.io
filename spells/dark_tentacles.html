<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/conju.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl4">Level IV</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=conju">Conjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 18 squares (27m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 4-square area on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.<br/>
When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, roll spellpower vs Reflex. On hit, the creature takes <span class="crsh">3d6 crushing damage</span> and is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles automatically takes <span class="crsh">3d6 crushing damage</span>.<br/>
The restrained creature or one that can touch that creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check vs 8 + spellpower. The restrained creature can also use its action to make an Escape Artist (must be proficient) check vs 6 + spellpower. On a success, the target is freed.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
