<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 60 squares (90m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You take control of the air in a 30m cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell’s duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you’ve halted.
<ul>
  <li><u>Gusts.</u> A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction that you choose. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra square of movement for each square moved.</li>
  <li><u>Downdraft.</u> You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. Roll spellpower vs Firmness against any creature that flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On hit, the creature is knocked prone.</li>
  <li><u>Updraft.</u> You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube’s bottom edge. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 3m higher than normal.</li>
</ul>
