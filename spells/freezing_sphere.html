<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Rvery creature in a 6-square radius centered on a point within 60 squares (90m)<br/>

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 12cm over an area 9 square meters. This ice lasts for 10 rounds. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature, or one that is within 1 square of it, can use an action to make a Strength roll vs 8 + spellpower to break free.<br/>
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 8 squares) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 10 rounds, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.<br/><br/>
