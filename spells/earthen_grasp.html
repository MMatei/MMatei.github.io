<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> An unoccupied square on the ground that you can see within 6 squares (9m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises in the target square and reaches for one creature you can see within 1 square of it. Roll spellpower vs Firmness. On hit, the target takes <span class="crsh">2d6 crushing damage</span> and is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> for the spellâ€™s duration. As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who takes <span class="crsh">2d6 crushing damage</span>.<br/>
The restrained creature or one that can touch that creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check vs 8 + spellpower. The restrained creature can also use its action to make an Escape Artist (must be proficient) check vs 6 + spellpower. On a success, the target is freed.<br/>
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.<br/>
