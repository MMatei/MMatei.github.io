<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/><br/>
You choose one unoccupied square on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 1 square of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 crushing damage and is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> for the spellâ€™s duration. As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who takes 2d6 crushing damage.<br/>
To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.<br/>
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
