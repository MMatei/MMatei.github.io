<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds (ignores ritual casting time rule)<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> A mithral statuette in the shape of the target, worth at least 500gg per level of the target<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Until dispelled<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature within 6 squares (9m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Warding. On hit, choose one of the methods of imprisonment below. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.<br/>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Burial:</i></b> The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.</li>
  <li><b><i>Chaining:</i></b> Numerous heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target restrained in place. The chains look like rusted iron, but are in fact infinitely strong and cannot be broken by ordinary means.</li>
  <li><b><i>Hedged Prison:</i></b> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</li>
  <li><b><i>Minimus Containment:</i></b> The target shrinks to one hundredth of its normal size and is imprisoned inside a transparent gemstone. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</li>
  <li><b><i>Slumber:</i></b> The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Ending the Spell:</i></b> During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on game concepts such as level, class, or hit points.<br/>
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the statuette used to create it. The statuette cannot be reused in another such ritual without releasing the original target.
