<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=range">Ranger</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 bonus action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Self<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, roll spellpower vs Firmness to <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrain</a> the creature with magical vines until the spell ends. You have disadvantage on the roll if the creature is Large or bigger.<br/>
While restrained by this spell, the target takes <span class="pier">1d6 piercing damage</span> at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch that creature can use its action to make an Athletics check vs 8 + spellpower. The restrained creature can also use its action to make an Escape Artist (must be proficient) check vs 6 + spellpower. Large or bigger creatures have advantage on these checks. On a success, the target is freed.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.<br/><br/>

<i>Sturdy vines with sharp thorns start growing from the point of impact, quickly enveloping the target if it is not strong enough to resist. They then slowly squeeze the life out of the helpless victim.</i>
