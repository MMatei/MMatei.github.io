<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 150m<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "100m straight downward" or "upward 100m, at a 45-degree angle".<br/>
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 1 square of you when you cast this spell.<br/>
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take <span class="forc">4d6 force damage</span>, and the spell fails to teleport you.<br/><br/>

<i>You disappear with a faint popping sound and reappear at the stated location with the same pop. Informally known as Minor Teleport, a name that causes the highly pedantic a heart attack.</i>
