<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> Touch<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Until dispelled or triggered<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 3m in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 4 squares from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.<br/>
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Perception check vs 8 + spellpower to be found.<br/>
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br/>
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that donâ€™t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br/>
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the following effects that it will trigger:<br/>
<b>Explosive Runes.</b> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 4-square-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Roll spellpower vs DEX against every creature in the area. On hit, a creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph). On miss, a creature takes half as much damage.<br/>
<b>Spell Glyph.</b> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.
