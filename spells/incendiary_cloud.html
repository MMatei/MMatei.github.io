A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 4-square-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed disperses it.<br/>
When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.<br/>
At the start of each of your turns, the cloud moves 2 squares in a direction that you choose.
