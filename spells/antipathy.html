<b><i>Effect:</i></b> This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 60m cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.<br/>
<u>Antipathy.</u> The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 12 squares (18m) of it, roll spellpower vs Will. On hit, the target becomes <a href="../conditions/frightened.html">frightened</a> and remains so while it can see the target or is within 12 squares of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 12 squares from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 12 squares of it.<br/>
<u>Sympathy.</u> The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 12 squares of it, roll spellpower vs Will. On hit, the target must use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, you must roll spellpower vs Will to maintain the effect.<br/>
<u>Ending the Effect.</u> If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 12 squares of the target or able to see it, roll spellpower vs Will. On miss, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, you must also repeat the roll every 24 hours. Once this spell ends for a creature, it is immune to it for 10 rounds, after which time it can be affected again.
