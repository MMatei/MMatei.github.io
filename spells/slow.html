<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Material Components.</i></b> &nbsp;<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Intuition against up to six creatures of your choice in an 8-square (12m) cube within range. On hit a creature is affected, but the roll must be repeated at every start of your turn until the spell ends.<br/>
An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to Deflection and Reflex, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.<br/>
If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.<br/><br/>

<i>You trick your victim's mind into thinking that its muscles are really tired and at the limit of their capabilities. Any significant effort seems next to impossible to achieve, and the victim starts operating at half capacity.</i>
