Swarming, biting locusts fill a 4-square-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphereâ€™s area is difficult terrain.<br/>
When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
