You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 12m cube and that is within range, and choose one of the following effects.<br/>
<u>Transmute Rock to Mud.</u> Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of quicksand that remains for the spell's duration. Each creature that enters this area, ends its turn there, or was on it when you cast the spell sinks into the quicksand and is restrained. Escape requires a successful Athletics check against your spell save DC.<br/>
If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 crushing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The terrain below the ceiling become difficult terrain, as it is now caked in mud.<br/>
<u>Transmute Mud to Rock.</u> Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 6m deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a Strength check (DC 20) or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it.
