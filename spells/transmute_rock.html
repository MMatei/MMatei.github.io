<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Sn area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 12m cube and that is within 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Choose one of the following effects:<br/>
<u>Transmute Rock to Mud.</u> Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of quicksand that remains for the spell's duration. Each creature that enters this area, ends its turn there, or was on it when you cast the spell sinks into the quicksand and is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a>. Escape requires a successful Dexterity (Escape Artist) check vs 8 + spellpower.<br/>
If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Roll spellpower vs Reflex against creatures below the ceiling. On hit, deal <span class="crsh">4d8 crushing damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage. The terrain below the ceiling becomes difficult terrain, as it is now caked in mud.<br/>
<u>Transmute Mud to Rock.</u> Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 6m deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Roll spellpower vs Reflex against every creature in the mud. On hit, the creature becomes restrained by the rock. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it.
