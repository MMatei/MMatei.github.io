You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becaomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.<br/>
Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.<br/>
A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hp, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.<br/>
The GM might allow you to choose different targets, provided that they are similar to the provided examples (for example, you could transform bees instead of wasps).
