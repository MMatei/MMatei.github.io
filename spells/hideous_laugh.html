<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature you can see within 6 squares (9m) that is <a href="../rules.html#creature_intel">clever</a> or smarter<br/>

At the start of each of your turns, and each time the target takes damage, you must struggle to maintain control with another roll. You have disadvantage on this roll if it's triggered by damage. If you fail, the spell ends.<br/><br/>

<i>Uncontrollable laughter grips the creature, and it falls to the ground, helpless and unable to act. Despite its thunderous laughter, the creature is not amused in the slightest, but rather terrified over its lack of control over its muscles, and in some pain from the repeated contractions of its abdomen.</i>
