You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You choose one the following options for what appears:
<ul>
  <li>One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or lower.</li>
  <li>Two fey creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower.</li>
  <li>Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower.</li>
  <li>Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower.</li>
</ul>
An elemental fey creature by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hp or when the spell ends.<br/>
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.
