<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=warlo">Warlock</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature made of flesh that you can see within 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Endurance. On hit, the target is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> as its flesh begins to harden. Then, at the end of each of its turns, roll spellpower vs Endurance. If you successfully hit three times, the target is turned to stone and becomes <a href="../conditions/petrified.html">petrified</a> for the duration. If you miss three times, however, the spell ends. The successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.<br/>
If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.
