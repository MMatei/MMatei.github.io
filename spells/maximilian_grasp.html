<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/><br/>
You choose one unoccupied square on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 1 square of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 crushing damage and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration.<br/>
As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 crushing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>
To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.<br/>
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.<br/>
