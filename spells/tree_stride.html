You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 150m. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 1 square of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 150m and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree youâ€™re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 1 square of the destination tree, using another square of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 1 square of the tree you entered.<br/>
You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.
