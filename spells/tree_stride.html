The creature you touch gains the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 150m. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as the creature. It must use 1 square of movement to enter a tree. It instantly knows the location of all other trees of the same kind within 150m and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree it's in. The creature appears in a spot of its choice within 1 square of the destination tree, using another square of movement. If it has no movement left, it appears within 1 square of the tree it entered.<br/>
This ability can only be used once per round for the duration, and each turn must be ended outside a tree.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can bestow this effect on up to 6 creatures you touch.
