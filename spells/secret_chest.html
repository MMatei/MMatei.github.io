<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/conju.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl4">Level IV</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=conju">Conjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> A Tiny replica of the target object worth at least 50 gg<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 60 days<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> An object no bigger than a 1m cube within 1 square (1.5m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You hide the object, and all its contents, in a small sub-dimension of the Astral Plane. You must touch the object and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The spell will not work if there is a living creature inside the object.<br/>
While the chest remains on the Astral Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 1 square of you. You can send the chest back to the Astral Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.<br/>
The spell ends on the object if you cast it again on another, if the smaller replica is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger object is still in the Astral Plane, it is irretrievably lost. The chance to stumble across the exact sub-dimension of the Astral Plane where the object remains is infinitesimal.
