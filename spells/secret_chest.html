<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> Touch<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (an exquisite chest, no bigger than a 1m cube, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Instantaneous<br/><br/>
You hide a chest, and all its contents, in a small pocket of the Astral Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell.<br/>
While the chest remains on the Astral Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 1 square of you. You can send the chest back to the Astral Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.<br/>
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spellâ€™s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
