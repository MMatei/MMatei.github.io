<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=warlo">Warlock</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Corpses not decayed to skeletons within 2 squares (6m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Transform corpses in range into up to four ghouls (one for each corpse).<br/>
As a quick action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 24 squares (36m) of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.<br/>
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.<br/>
