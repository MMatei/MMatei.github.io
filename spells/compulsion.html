<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Creatures of your choice that you can see within 6 squares (9m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Will. The spell fails on targets that canâ€™t be charmed. On hit, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a quick action on each of your turns to designate a direction. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, though it can take any action before it moves. If compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or a pit, the target must successfully be compelled with another spellpower vs Will roll before it moves.
