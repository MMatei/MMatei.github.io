Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it canâ€™t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, though it can take any action before it moves. If compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or a pit, the target gets an additional Wisdom save to end the spell before it moves.
