<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=warlo">Warlock</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at the target. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you have used magic to influence its mood and will react according to its personality and the nature of your interaction with it. A wrathful person might attack you, a meek person might accept it, while another might seek retribution later (all at the GMâ€™s discretion).<br/>

<i>A gentle tug at the victim's mind in the right place is like the most beautiful of smiles. Their face brightens up and they are ready to talk about anything. Mortals can be so pitiful at times.</i>
