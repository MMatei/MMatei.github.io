<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> A statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gg<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 10 days<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Self<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell, called the contingent spell, as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesnâ€™t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.<br/>
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then the contingency ends.<br/>
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
