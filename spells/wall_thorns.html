<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>

<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>

<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 12 squares long, 3m high, and 1.5m thick or a circle that has a 4-square diameter and is up to 6m high and 1.5m thick. The wall blocks line of sight.<br/>
When the wall appears, roll spellpower vs Reflex against every creature in the area. On hit, deal <span class="pier">7d8 piercing damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.<br/>
A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 square a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 squares of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, roll spellpower vs Reflex. On hit, deal <span class="pier">7d8 piercing damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.<br/>
