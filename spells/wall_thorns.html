<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>School:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html#lvl6">Level 6</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=conju">Conjuration</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Components:</i></b> V, S, M (a handful of thorns)<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/><br/>
You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 12 squares long, 3m high, and 1.5m thick or a circle that has a 4-square diameter and is up to 6m high and 1.5m thick. The wall blocks line of sight.<br/>
When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.<br/>
A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 square a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 squares of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
