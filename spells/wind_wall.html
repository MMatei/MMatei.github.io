<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/abjur.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl3">Level III</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=abjur">Abjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=range">Ranger</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You form a wind wall up to 10 squares long and 5m tall, starting from a point within range. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.<br/>
When you create the wall, roll spellpower vs Firmness against every creature in its path. On hit, deal <span class="crsh">3d8 crushing damage</span>, or half as much damage on a miss.<br/>
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Creatures in gaseous form and Small or Tiny flying creatures or objects canâ€™t pass through the wall. Medium or smaller creatures must suceed on a Strength (Athletics) check vs 8 + your spellpower in order to pass through the wind wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, can pass through, but lose one die of damage.<br/><br/>

<i>You call the winds to your aid, forming a barrier of violent gales that repels most missiles and foes.</i>
