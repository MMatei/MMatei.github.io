<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 300m<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 2 squares of you and one point within 300m of you. A circular portal, 3m in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.<br/>
The portals are two dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering centimeters from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.<br/>
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a quick action so that the active side faces in a different direction. You can also end the effect as a free action.
