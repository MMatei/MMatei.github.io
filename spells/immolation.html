Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for 10 rounds. The burning target sheds bright light in a 6 square radius and dim light for an additional 6 squares and (only if it can be frightened and isn't immune to fire) it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.<br/>
These magical flames canâ€™t be extinguished through nonmagical means. If damage from this spell reduces a target to 0 hp, the target is turned to ash.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
