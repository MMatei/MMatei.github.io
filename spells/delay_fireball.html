<h1 align="center">Delayed Fireball</h1>
<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/proto.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl7">Level VII</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=proto">Protomancy</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> Every creature in a 4-square radius centered on a point within 30 squares (45m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration.<br/>
When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Roll spellpower vs Reflex. On hit, deal the accumulated <span class="fire">fire damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.<br/>
The spell's base damage is 12d6. At the end of each of your turns, if the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.<br/>
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must roll Dexterity vs 8 + spellpower to prevent it from exploding immediately. If successful, the creature can throw the bead up to 8 squares. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.<br/>
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
