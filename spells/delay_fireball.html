<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>School:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html#lvl7">Level 7</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=evoca">Evocation</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 30 squares (45m)<br/>
<b><i>Components:</i></b> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/><br/>
A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration.<br/>
When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 4-square-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>
The spell's base damage is 12d6. At the end of each of your turns, if the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.<br/>
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 8 squares. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.<br/>
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
