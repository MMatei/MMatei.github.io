<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 24 squares (36m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/><br/>
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 1-square-radius, 12m-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.<br/>
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.<br/>
On each of your turns after you cast this spell use can use an action to place the beam on another square, up to 12 squares away from the previous location.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
