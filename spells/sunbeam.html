A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 1-square-wide, 12-square-line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br/>
You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.<br/>
For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 6-square radius and dim light for an additional 6 squares. The light is sunlight.
