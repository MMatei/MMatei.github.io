<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/conju.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl3">Level III</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=conju">Conjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=warlo">Warlock</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 30 squares (45m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A 4-square-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 6 squares away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a>.<br/>
The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes <span class="cold">2d6 cold damage</span>. Furthermore, roll spellpower vs Reflex against any creature that ends its turn in the area. On hit, a target takes <span class="acid">2d6 acid damage</span> as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
