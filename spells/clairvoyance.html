<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorc">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 minute<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 2 km<br/>
<b><i>Material Components.</i></b> An ivory horn for hearing and a realistic glass eye for seeing, worth at least 50 gg each<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it canâ€™t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.<br/>
When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing. The sensor has darkvision and enhanced hearing.<br/>
The sensor is invisible, but can be seen by creatures that have truesight as a luminous, intangible orb about 3 cm in diameter.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, it becomes possible to move the sensor by as much as 6 squares (9m) per turn. There is no limit to how far away from you the sensor can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence, and it can't pass through solid obstacles. Furthermore, the duration becomes concentration, up to 1 hour.
