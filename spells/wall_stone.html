A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 12cm thick and is composed of ten 3-by-3 meter panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 3-by-6 meter panels that are only 6cm thick.<br/>
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.<br/>
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn’t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.<br/>
If you create a span greater than 4 squares in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.<br/>
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 20 hp per cm of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hp destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.<br/>
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.
