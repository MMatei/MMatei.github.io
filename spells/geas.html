You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of actiity as you decide.<br/>
If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom save or become <a href="../conditions/charmed.html">charmed</a> by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 4d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.<br/>
You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
