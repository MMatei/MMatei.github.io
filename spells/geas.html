<h1 align="center">Quest</h1>
<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/encha.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl5">Level V</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=encha">Noumancy</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=palad">Paladin</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 30 days<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A creature you can see within 12 squares (18m), that can understand you<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Intuition. On hit, the target is <a href="../conditions/charmed.html">charmed</a> by you for the duration and you can issue it a command or prohibition, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. While the creature is under this spell, it takes <span class="psyc">4d10 psychic damage</span> each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.<br/>
You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A <a href="remove_curse.html">remove curse</a>, <a href="greater_restoration.html">greater restoration</a>, or <a href="wish.html">wish</a> spell also ends it.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.<br/><br/>

<i>You bind a creature with a magical command it comes to identify with, to the point that it begins to suffer harrowing depression should it find itself unable to conform to the specified course of action.</i>
<i>Balthazzar the Mad made liberal use of this spell to compel people to a life of strict vegetarianism when he realized he could not convert them by ordinary means.</i>
