You create a 4-square-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration, unless dispersed by strong wind.<br/>
Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Furthermore, even if it starts its next turn outside the cloud, the creature must make another Constitution save to avoid retching again. Creatures that donâ€™t need to breathe or are immune to poison aren't affected.
