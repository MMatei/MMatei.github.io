<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> Ruby powder worth 50 gg, which the spell consumes<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 1 hour<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 20 squares (30m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose. A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 4 squares on a side and is made from 1cm diameter bars spaced 2cm apart.<br/>
A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 2 squares on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area.<br/>
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cageâ€™s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.<br/>
A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma roll vs 8 + spellpower. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.<br/>
This spell can't be dispelled by <a href="dispel_magic.html">dispel magic</a>.
