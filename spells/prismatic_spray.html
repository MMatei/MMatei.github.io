<ol>
  <li><u>Red.</u> On hit, deal <span class="fire">10d8 fire damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.</li>
  <li><u>Orange.</u> On hit, deal <span class="acid">10d8 acid damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.</li>
  <li><u>Yellow.</u> On hit, deal <span class="elec">10d8 electric damage</span>. On miss, deal half damage.</li>

  <li><u>Indigo.</u> On hit, the target is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a>. Then, at the end of each of its turns, roll spellpower vs Endurance. On three misses, the spell ends. On three hits, it permanently turns to stone and it becomes <a href="../conditions/petrified.html">petrified</a>. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.</li>
  <li><u>Violet.</u> On hit, the target is <a href="../conditions/blinded.html">blinded</a>. At the start of your next turn, roll spellpower vs Warding. On miss, the blindness ends. On hit, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)</li>
  <li><u>Special.</u> The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</li>
