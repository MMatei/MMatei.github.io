<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (an bit of fleece)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> Roll spellpower vs INT against a target within range that isn't <a href="../rules.html#creature_intel">mindless</a>. On hit, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 2-square cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.<br/>
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Investigation check vs 8 + spellpower. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.<br/>
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall: it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.<br/>
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal <span class="psyc">1d6 psychic damage</span> to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 1 square of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.<br/>

<i>Black wisps surround the target and hijack its senses, making it see, feel and smell what the caster wishes. The spell is not powerful enough to completely overtake the creature's senses, however. Only a small section of reality can be altered.</i>
