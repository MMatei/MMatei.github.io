<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 2 hours<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 6 squares (9m)<br/>
<b><i>Material Components.</i></b> A focus in the shape of a gate, with the rims made of platinum and the center a single large diamond, all worth at least 5,000 gg, which the spell consumes<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 5 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 1 to 4 squares in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.<br/>
The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.<br/>
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.<br/>
When you cast this spell, you can speak the true name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creatureâ€™s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. As long as you are still concentrating on the spell, you can instantly banish the creature to its home plane and close the portal behind it.<br/>
If you cast this spell on a specially prepared gate structure, then the duration of the portal becomes permanent. The knowledge of how to craft such a structure, however, is very obscure, and is being actively hunted to be destroyed by followers of the good deities, in order to prevent a permanent gate from being opened to one of the evil planes. Such an event could very well be catastrophic to the Material Plane.
