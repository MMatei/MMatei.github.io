You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 90m and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form.<br/>
Reverting takes 10 rounds, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 10-round transformation.<br/>
If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 18m per round for 10 rounds until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 10 rounds, the creature falls the remaining distance.
