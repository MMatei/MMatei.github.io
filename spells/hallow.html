<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 24 hours<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> Touch<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Permanent<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy or unholy power (your choice). The area can have a radius up to 12 squares, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.<br/>
First, celestials and fey (if unholy) or fiends and undead (if holy), as well as aberrations and elementals, cannot enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can choose to exempt aberrations or elementals from this effect.<br/>
Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or negotiate an effect of similar power with the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can roll spellpower vs CHA in order to apply the effect on them.
