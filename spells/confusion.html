This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled actions. Each creature in a 2-square-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.<br/>
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-6. The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7-8. The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing ths turn.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9-10. The creature can act and move normally.<br/>
At the end of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. It it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 1 square for each slot level above 4th.
