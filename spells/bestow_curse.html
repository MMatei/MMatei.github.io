<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> A creature within 1 square (1.5m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> Roll spellpower vs Warding. On hit, the target is cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
<ul>
  <li>Choose one attribute. While cursed, all rolls that receive a bonus from that attribute are rolled with disadvantage. Attacks against the <a href="../rules.html#defenses">associated defense</a> are made with advantage.</li>
  <li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
  <li>While cursed, you get to roll spellpower vs Warding at the start of each of the target's turns. On hit, the creature wastes its entire turn doing nothing.</li>
  <li>While the target is cursed, your successful attacks and spells deal an extra <span class="necr">1d10 necrotic damage</span> to the target.</li>
</ul>
With approval from the GM, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect.<br/>
A <a href="remove_curse.html">remove curse</a> spell ends this effect.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels:</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesnâ€™t require concentration.<br/><br/>
