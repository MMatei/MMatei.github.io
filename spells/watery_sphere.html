<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 18 squares (27m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You conjure up a sphere of water with a 2-square radius on a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover in the air, but no more than 3m off the ground. The sphere remains for the spellâ€™s duration.<br/>
Roll spellpower vs Firmness against every creature in the sphere's space. On hit, a creature is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, you must repeat the roll to keep the target restrained. On miss, a target is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside it. You automatically miss Huge or larger creatures.<br/>
The sphere can restrain a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature in excess of these numbers, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 1 square of it.<br/>
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 6 squares in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 3m over ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into a creature, thus making the roll to restrain it, but no more than once per turn.<br/>
When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 6 squares of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls.
