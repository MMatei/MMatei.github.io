<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 100 squares (150m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 30m-radius circle centered on that point, shaking creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.<br/>
The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution roll vs 8 + spellpower to maintain it.<br/>
When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, roll spellpower vs Reflex against every creature in the area. On hit, the creature is knocked <a href="../conditions/prone.html">prone</a>.<br/>
This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.<br/>
<u>Fissures.</u> Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 2d10 meters deep, 2 squares wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) roll vs 8 + spellpower or fall in. On success the creature moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).<br/>

<u>Structures.</u> The tremor deals <span class="crsh">50 crushing damage</span> to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hp, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. Roll spellpower vs Reflex against creatures within half the distance of a structure’s height. On hit, the creature takes <span class="crsh">5d6 crushing damage</span>, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On miss, the creature only takes half damage.
