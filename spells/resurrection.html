<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=cleri">Cleric</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> A diamond worth at least 1,000 gg, which the spell consumes<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Instantaneous<br/>
<b><i>Target:</i></b> A dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead within 1 square (1.5m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.<br/>
This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such affects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.<br/>
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.<br/>
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all rolls it makes and to all its defenses except Deflection. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.<br/>
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you take a -4 penalty to all rolls you make and to all defenses except Deflection.
