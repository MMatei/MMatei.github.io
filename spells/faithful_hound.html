<h5 align="center"><img src="../icons/conju.png"/> <a href="../spells.html#lvl4">Level IV</a> <a href="../spells.html?ms=conju">Conjuration</a></h5>
<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> 8 hours<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 20 squares (30m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You conjure a fey that takes the form of big watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 20 squares (30m) away from it.<br/>
The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and canâ€™t be harmed. When a creature comes within 6 squares of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly (you choose whether this barking should only be audible to you, to all friendly creatures, or to everyone). The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.<br/>
The hound attempts to bite any hostile creature that approaches within 2 squares of it. Furthermore, at the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 2 squares of it that is hostile to you. The hound rolls spellpower vs Deflection. On hit, it deals <span class="pier">4d8 piercing damage</span>.<br/><br/>

<i>A wizard's best friend when camping in an unsecured location or particularly seedy inn. Invented by the paranoid archmage Mordekainen, who never slept without at least one faithful hound by his side.</i>
