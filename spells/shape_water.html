<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 6 squares (9m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> S<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-square (1.5m) cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 1 square in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.</li>
    <li>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>You change the waterâ€™s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.<br/>
