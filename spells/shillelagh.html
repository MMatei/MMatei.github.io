<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=druid">Druid</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 bonus action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> Touch<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (a club or quarterstaff)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> 10 rounds<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weaponâ€™s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.<br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> At level 5, the weapon's damage die becomes a d10. At level 11, the weapon's damage die becomes a d12.<br/><br/>

<i>You imbue your wooden weapon with the vigor of nature. The wood grows and thickens in your hands, and it is now harder than steel and just as deadly. The wood contorts to offer you the best grip, and you feel as if the weapon is an extension of your own hand, to the point where you can handily rival master swordsmen in technique.</i>
