<b><i>Classes.</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (a bit of spider web)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br/>
<b><i>Effect.</i></b> You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 4-square cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.<br/>
If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 1m.<br/>
Roll spellpower vs DEX against every creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn. On hit, the creature is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs, or another creature that touches it, can use its action to make a Force check vs 8 + spellpower. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.<br/>
The webs are flammable and will burn away in 1 round, dealing <span class="fire">2d4 fire damage</span> to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
