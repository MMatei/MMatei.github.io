You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 4-square cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.<br/>
If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 1m.<br/>
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is <a href="../conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength cheek against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.<br/>
The webs are flammable and will burn away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
