<b><i>Classes:</i></b> <a href="../spells.html?cc=bards">Bard</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=sorce">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="../spells.html?cc=wizar">Wizard</a><br/>
<b><i>Casting Time:</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Material Components:</i></b> &mdash;<br/>
<b><i>Duration:</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br/>
<b><i>Range:</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Effect:</i></b> You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 4m cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isnâ€™t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.<br/>
You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.<br/>
Roll spellpower to determine the quality of the illusion. Any creature with a Passive Perception equal or greater will disbelieve the illusion. A creature can also actively investigate the illusion, rolling Perception against the illusion's quality. If a creature physically inspects the illusion and its hand passes through, it automatically disbelieves it. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, then it becomes faint to the creature.<br/>
