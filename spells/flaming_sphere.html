<b><i>Casting Time.</i></b> 1 action<br/>
<b><i>Range.</i></b> 12 squares (18m)<br/>
<b><i>Components.</i></b> V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)<br/>
<b><i>Duration.</i></b> Concentration, up to 10 rounds<br/><br/>
A 1-square-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 1 square of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>
As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 6 squares. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphereâ€™s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.<br/>
When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 1.5m tall and jump it across pits up to 2 squares wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 4-square radius and dim light for an additional 4 squares.<br/><br/>
<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
