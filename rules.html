<h4>Measuring Distance</h4>
<p>D&amp;D was designed with grid-based combat in mind. Therefore, in all circumstances related to combat (abilities, spells, effects, speed etc), distance will be measured in squares. As a contingency for freeform scenarios, the distance in meters will be displayed within brackets. For reference, a square was originally defined as 5 by 5 feet, which roughly translates to 1.5 by 1.5 meters (error is negligible for the small distances involved in the typical combat).</p>
<h4>Rounding Down</h4>
<p>Whenever you divide a number in the game, always round down.</p>
<h4>Advantage and disadvantage</h4>
<p>When someone has advantage on a roll, he rolls two dice and selects the best result. When someone has disadvantage on a roll, he rolls two dice and selects the worst result.</p>
<p>You cannot stack advantages or disadvantages on a roll (you never roll more than two d20s). If a situation brings both an advantage and a disadvantage, they cancel each other out. If you have a trait that allows you to reroll, you can only reroll one of the dice, but you choose which one.</p>


<br/><h1 id="characterCreation">Creating a Character</h1>
<h4>Step 1: Choose a Race</h4>
<p>Choose one of the following races: <a href="races/dragonborn.html">dragonborn</a>, <a href="races/dwarf.html">dwarf</a>, <a href="races/elf.html">elf</a>, <a href="races/halfling.html">halfling</a>, <a href="races/human.html">human</a>, <a href="races/half_elf.html">half-elf</a>, <a href="races/half_orc.html">half-orc</a> or <a href="races/tiefling.html">tiefling</a>. Your race determines your base speed, the languages you can speak, as well as a number of racial traits, all of which you should note on your character sheet. Some races may provide adjustments to your ability scores; keep these in mind for step 3.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Choose a Class</h4>
<p>Every adventurer has a certain vocation that determines his/her skills and talents. It is possible to multiclass your adventurer later on, although this is an advanced feature only recommended to experienced players. For the moment, however, you must choose one of the following classes: <a href="classes/barbarian.html">berserker</a>, <a href="classes/bard.html">bard</a>, <a href="classes/cleric.html">cleric</a>, <a href="classes/druid.html">druid</a>, <a href="classes/fighter.html">fighter</a>, <a href="classes/monk.html">monk</a>, <a href="classes/paladin.html">paladin</a>, <a href="classes/ranger.html">ranger</a>, <a href="classes/rogue.html">rogue</a>, <a href="classes/sorcerer.html">sorcerer</a>, <a href="classes/warlock.html">warlock</a>, <a href="classes/wizard.html">wizard</a>. Your starting class determines your starting hit points, proficiencies and equipment. There might also be some features gained at level 1. Note all of these on your character sheet.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Determine Ability Scores</h4>
<p>The ability scores for your character are determined using a point buy system. You start with 8 points which you can spend however you like to buy your character's six ability scores, according to the following table:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>Score</td><td>-1</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>+3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cost</td><td>-1</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+3</td><td>+6</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Step 4: Your Character's Personality</h4>
<p>You should pick a personality you can identify with and keep it in mind in all interactions with other characters. If roleplaying isn't your thing, then you should have a character with your personality and play the game as if you are present there in the flesh. Personality can spice up the game and make it more engaging for all those involved. It puts the role in role-play.</p>
<p>Begin by selecting a background for your character (starting at page 128 in the PHB). The background may also provide some additional proficiencies, languages and equipment, which you should note on your character sheet. You should then select two personality traits, an ideal, a bond, and a flaw for your character. You may roll on the tables if you lack inspiration, but you are strongly encouraged to tailor the character to your liking. You can even customize your background if you wish, subject to DM approval.</p>
<p>The DM will take notes on your personality for future reference, especially your flaw, which may be turned against you during the adventure. At this point, you also select the alignment of your character, which serves mostly as a statement of general intent regarding your personality. Depending on the setting, this alignment may or may not be important to the story. Regardless, you are free to act out your character in any way you choose. The DM will adjust your perceived alignment accordingly.</p>
<p>For extra authenticity, you should also keep your ability scores in mind when roleplaying. Low intelligence might mean a lackluster memory, and perhaps even a reduced ability to reason. Low charisma might mean that perhaps you're shy, or socially awkward, or just have an abrasive personality. Low wisdom might mean obliviousness to detail, recklessness or stubbornness. Don't be afraid of playing a flawed character, for it might make the story more interesting in unexpected ways. And seeing a character overcome his/her limitations always makes for a good story.</p>


<br/><h1 id="core">Core Concepts</h1>
<p>Your character's raw physical and mental capacities are defined by six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Memory, Intuition and Charisma. These are numbers ranging from a minimum of -5 (meaning complete and utter lack of said ability), to 0 (the ability of the average human), to +5 (the peak of ability for most mortal heroes) and even more for some very powerful beings.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Skills describe the character's proficiency in a certain task. In the following, each skill is associated to a particular ability, but this association is not mandatory. Depending on the way a character approaches a task, a skill may use a different ability score. Whatever the ability used, the associated skill receives a bonus to it equal to the attribute.</p>
<h4>Strength (STR)</h4>
<p>Strength measures both bodily strength and athletic training, the extent to which your strength can also be put to good use. Strength checks are used when pushing or pulling heavy objects, shoving enemies etc. For melee attacks (except those made with weapons with the [Finesse] tag) and attacks with thrown weapons, you add STR to hit roll and damage, provided you are proficient with the weapon you use.</p>
<p id="encumbrance"> You can comfortably carry a maximum of 25 + 5 * STR kg. If needed, you can carry up to 50% more, but you suffer one level of <a href="conditions/exhaustion.html">exhaustion</a> every hour. Tiny creatures can carry only half this amount. For every size over Medium, the carrying capacity is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Force.</i></b> Whenever brute force needs to be applied to a problem, this is the skill to go for. Handling heavy objects in a hurry, breaking down obstacles or ripping offending objects to shreds are the usual applications of raw force.</p>
<h4>Dexterity (DEX)</h4>
<p>Dexterity measures the ability to be agile, nimble, or move quietly. It also covers talent in actions that require precision, such as disarming traps, picking locks, or manufacturing and manipulating delicate objects. Some armors allow you to add part (or all) of your DEX to your Armor Class (AC). When unarmored, you add your entire DEX to your AC. For ranged attacks except thrown weapons and for melee attacks with weapons with the [Finesse] tag, you add DEX to hit roll and damage, provided that you are proficient with the weapon you use.</p>
<p><b><i>Acrobatics.</i></b> Used for acrobatic stunts (flips, somersaults, rolls etc) and for keeping one's footing on slippery or unsteady terrain (such as a tight rope, or a quaking surface).</p>
<p><b><i>Escape Artist.</i></b> Used to escape from all sorts of restraints, including an enemy's grapple.</p>
<p><b><i>Mechanics.</i></b> Covers both knowledge of mechanical devices (such as locks or traps) and the ability to tinker with them in a safe way. Used to safely investigate a trap, disarm it, or unlock a door.</p>
<p><b><i>Sleight of hand.</i></b> This covers all sorts of trickeries and subtle movements that you want to go unnoticed, such as pickpocketing, or drawing a knife without being noticed.</p>
<p><b><i>Stealth.</i></b> Used when you want to hide from somebody.</p>
<h4>Constitution (CON)</h4>
<p>Measures one's vitality and ability to withstand exertion, as well as toxins, poisons, alcohool, and diseases. There are trying situations aplenty that may call for a simple Constitution check, such as trying to outdrink someone, trying to hold the contents of your stomach in the presence of a pungent smell, or trying to endure punishment without making a sound.</p>
<p>For every level you have, you add your Constitution modifier to your max hp. If you temporarily gain or lose Constitution, then you also have to adjust your max hp accordingly. Any addition to max hp is also made to current hp.</p>
<p><b><i>Athletics.</i></b> Covers climbing, jumping, swimming and other strenuous physical activity that is more a question of sustaining effort, rather than pure application of brute strength.</p>
<h4>Memory (MEM)</h4>
<p>The character's capacity to store knowledge, as well as the skill to put that knowledge to good use. A character with good memory won't just recite a book on elven history - he will point out the specific passage that is relevant to the problem at hand. However, the actual task of reasoning on the available information is left to the player. Memory checks are used to appraise an item, win at a game of skill, forge documents, or concoct a suitable disguise.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcana.</i></b> Deals with knowledge about anything magical in nature: spells, rituals, other planes of existence and their inhabitants. For Wizards, Spellblades and Arcane Tricksters, it determines their ability to memorise the intricate arcane magic, thus determining their spellpower.</p>
<p><b><i>Crafting.</i></b> Your knowledge and skill in manually crafting a certain category of objects. When you choose to become proficient in this skill, you must also choose a particular type of crafting to specialize in; for example: smithing, woodworking, weaving, masonry, alchemy, arcana, jewelry, brewing etc. You can have multiple Crafting proficiencies for separate categories.</p>
<p><b><i>Forgery.</i></b> Your skill in imitating the writing or drawing style of others, so as to be able to produce documents (or other objects) that can be attributed to someone else.</p>
<p><b><i>History.</i></b> Your knowledge about the history of the world (anything that can be found in a historic text or in bardic poems). It has some overlap with Arcana and Religion, but only in regards to historical facts.</p>
<p><b><i>Linguistics.</i></b> Your ability to pick up new (or slightly different) languages. With enough study or checks for the same language, you might even become fluent in it.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine.</i></b> Ability to care for the sick and stabilize unconscious characters.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature.</i></b> Your knowledge about the natural world: plants, beasts, terrain and weather cycles.</p>
<p><b><i>Religion.</i></b> Your knowledge about the Deities of the world, their rituals, priesthoods and philosophy. Since some religious artifacts are magical in nature, it might overlap with Arcana, and both checks would be valid for such information.</p>
<h4>Intuition (INT)</h4>
<p>A combination of life experience, perception and attunement to the environment. It is a measure of your attention to what is going on and can be actively employed to discern the unusual.</p>
<p><b><i>Animal handling.</i></b> Your capacity to calm down an animal, tame it, or understand its behavior.</p>
<p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> Determines the strength of your connection to the source of your magical power. For Clerics, it is their chosen Deity; for Druids and Rangers, it is the natural world; for Monks, it is the self. For all these classes, Attunement determines spellpower. Attunement may also be useful in order to detect and interpret unusual magical phenomena.</p>
<p><b><i>Insight.</i></b> Determine the intentions and emotions of the creature you are interacting with, for example to determine whether they are lying.</p>
<p><b><i>Perception.</i></b> Used when trying to spot or detect something. Note that all important features that are in plain sight will be automatically noticed by the character, while hidden features can be automatically discovered by a character with high enough Passive Perception. A perception check is required only when actively searching for something (with the DC determined by how specific the search is).</p>
<p><b><i>Survival.</i></b> Ability to survive in wilderness, to find food, water and shelter. It is also the ability to track a creature and hunt.</p>
<h4>Charisma (CHA)</h4>
<p>Measures the ability to influence others and make a positive impact on them. It is very important in social interactions, and can also be used to gather rumors from a crowd.</p>
<p><b><i>Deception.</i></b> The ability to hide information or outright lie in a social interaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Friendliness.</i></b> The ability to socialize with unknown people, get them to like you and to talk freely to you. Used chiefly in order to gather information in unknown locales, but also to help warm up a character for a more productive interaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Intimidation.</i></b> Attempting to influence someone through threats, hostile actions and implied violence.</p>
<p><b><i>Performance.</i></b> Ability to act out a role, whether to deceive someone (outright lying is deception, not performance), or to entertain an audience.</p>
<p><b><i>Persuasion.</i></b> Ability to influence someone to view you favorably. Note that to actually persuade someone, you still need convincing arguments (see <a href="#socialInteract">Social Interaction</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Will.</i></b> Used to defeat compulsions and mind control, but more importantly, to master one's inner source of magic. For Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers and Warlocks, Will determines their spellpower.</p>
<h3>Other stats</h3>
<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>
<p>The Proficiency Bonus is a number determined by a character's highest level class (see class progression table). This bonus is added to every skill or attribute defense the character is proficient in (proficiencies are explicitly determined by a character's class and choices during character creation).</p>
<h4>Defenses</h4>
<p>Every character has seven defenses against a hostile attacks. The first and most straightforward is Armor Class (AC), which defends against physical attacks. The base AC is 10 + DEX, but this value can be modified by armor and/or spells. Some armors may restrict the size of the DEX modifier that can be added to AC; this restriction applies only to positive values. The other six defenses cover each of the six attributes and are explicitly named in the description of the attack. The value of these defenses equals 12 + skill + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable).</p>
<p>Strength defense guards against attempts to overpower the character. Dexterity defense represents reflexes that can dodge peril at the last moment. Constitution defense represents the fortitude to withstand toxins, disease or other strains on the body. Memory defense guards against hostile magic that targets neither the senses nor one's will. Intuition defense guards against illusions and trickery. Charisma defense guards against attacks that seek to twist the mind and subvert one's will.</p>
<h4>Passive Proficiencies</h4>
<p>All Proficiencies (skills, weapons, and armor) are assumed to represent both active uses of those things and relevant background knowledge, lore, information, and awareness, as well as passive defenses to situations that might test that skill. A character’s Passive Proficiency is equal to 10 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus. If the character has Advantage on such skill checks, the Passive Proficiency gains an additional +5. If the character has Disadvantage, the character suffers an additional -5. Any bonus that can be granted to a skill roll, such as from Bardic Inspiration or from a Cleric’s bless spell may also be applied to Passive Proficiencies.</p>
<p><i>Example 1: Alice encounters a strange mural depicting an unknown figure. If she has proficiency in Religion and Passive Religion is greater or equal to the DC, then the GM informs her that she recognizes the mural as a depiction of the long-forgotten Goddess Asura.</i></p>
<p><i>Example 2: A thief tries to sneak past Alice. To succeed, the thief must roll Stealth equal or higher to Alice's Passive Perception.</i></p>
<h4>Tasks that require tools</h4>
<p>There are some tasks that can only be performed if one has the adequate tools. For example, picking a lock requires thieves' tools. The GM may allow improvised tools to work (provided that said tools can be improvised with the resources at hand), but the check will be performed with disadvantage. Note that adequate tools can actually be crafted by a professional - for example, a skilled smith can probably craft a set of thieves' tools (even with an improvised forge), which will then behave as a set bought from a merchant. Improvisation refers specifically to employing objects that were not meant for the task at hand.</p>
<h3>The Core Mechanic</h3>
<p>When a player declares an action – which includes a desired outcome and an approach anticipated to bring about that action – the GM determines the outcome and describes the result. First, the GM determines whether there is a chance that the action might succeed and a chance that the action might fail. If the GM determines the action can’t succeed, the action is a failure, though the GM may warn the player of the impossibility of the action instead. If the GM determines the action can’t fail, the action is a success. If the GM determines that the action can fail, but there is no risk or cost for failure such that the player can keep trying until they succeed, the action is a success. Otherwise, the GM uses the Core Mechanic to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>Under the Core Mechanic, based on the approach the player is using, the GM determines which Ability (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Memory, Intuition, or Charisma) governs the action. The GM also determines an appropriate Difficulty Class for the action. The GM – possibly with help from the player – determines whether the character has a Skill relevant to the task. The GM also determines any circumstantial Modifiers. Modifiers can include a static bonus or penalty or the roll can be made with Advantage or Disadvantage.</p>
<p>Once all of that has been determined, the player rolls 1d20 and adds the relevant Ability Modifier, Bonuses and Penalties, and their Proficiency Bonus (if relevant). If the total equals or exceeds the chosen Difficulty Class, the action succeeds. If not, the action fails. If the roll is made with Advantage, the player rolls 2d20 and uses the highest single die roll. If the roll is made with Disadvantage, the player rolls 2d20 and uses the lowest single die roll.</p>
<p>If an action succeeds, the player either accomplishes their desired outcome or makes progress toward that outcome. If the action fails, the player does not accomplish their desired outcome and may suffer costs or risks associated with the roll. Regardless of the success or failure of the action, the GM may also apply consequences based on the player’s approach. The GM describes the results and applies any necessary consequences. Then play continues.</p>
<p>A roll of 1 means automatic failure, modifiers notwithstanding; the character has fumbled and made a particularly poor attempt. A roll of 20, on the other hand, means a critical success - the character succeeds even if his roll doesn't exceed the DC. If the roll is to be succeeded by rolling damage or healing dice, then you add the maximum result of the roll to your roll (so 1d6 becomes 6 + 1d6). If the roll was made to apply, or continue to apply, an effect, then the duration of the effect is extended by one turn.</p>
<p>Pre-determined checks are described as "DC x Skill (ability)", where x is the number to be matched or exceeded for the check to succeed. Some DCs may allow the choice between two skills or two abilities. Attacks against an enemy are instead described as "Attack AC" or "Attack DEX".</p>
<h4>Reacting to Danger</h4>
<p>Whenever a character is in immediate danger, but has a split second to react, the GM can invoke this rule. The GM describes what the character is aware of. The player then describes their reaction. The GM then determines if the reaction could avoid or mitigate the unexpected event, whether it can succeed, and whether it can fail. The GM can then ask for an Ability Check based on the action, or may impose advantage/disadvantage on the effect. Any spell that can be cast as a Reaction can be used in this instance.</p>
<h4>Working Together</h4>
<p>When two or more characters work together to accomplish the same task, the character with the higher modifier leads the effort. The leader makes the appropriate ability check and enjoys a +2 bonus for one or two helpers or a +5 bonus for three or more helpers. Characters can only work together if the task is such that help is feasible and possible. In addition, a character can only help with a task if they are capable of attempting the task on their own (for example, in cases where Proficiency is required).</p>
<h4>Group Checks</h4>
<p>When several PCs are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM can call for a group check. First, the GM determines whether the group will succeed if any member succeeds (such as with searching) or if the group will fail if any member fails (such as with stealth).</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the group rolls a single check using the highest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have advantage on the check, the check is made with advantage. If any member of the group is benefiting from any bonuses that would apply to the check, the best single one of those bonuses is also applied to the check.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, the group rolls a single check using the lowest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have disadvantage on the check, the check is made with disadvantage. If any member of the group is suffering from any penalties that would affect the check, the single worst one of those penalties is also applied to the check.</p>


<br/><h1 id="encounters">Encounters</h1>
<p>In encounter play, characters are making moment-by-moment decisions and taking very short actions (each taking up just a few seconds). They may or may not be following an initiative order. These include various sub-modes of play like combat, chase scenes, action scenes, and social interactions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Determine what each side intends to achieve and how it intends to achieve it.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> If one side wants to attack the other by surprise, determine who is surprised.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> If combat is to ensue, roll initiative.</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> Place each combatant on a grid, noting important battlefield features.</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> In descending order of initiative, each character takes its turn, until the conflict is solved.</p>
<h4>Surprise</h4>
<p>A character is considered to be surprised if it fails to spot any of the incoming attackers (each attacker succeeds on a DC Stealth [Passive Perception of character]). A surprised character can't take any action, nor any reaction, on the first turn of combat.</p>
<h4>Initiative</h4>
<p>The initiative of a character is given by a Dexterity roll. A group of identical creatures rolls only once, and acts at the same time. If two characters are tied, roll a d20 for each to determine who has the higher initiative.</p>
<h4>Damage Types</h4>
<p>There are 12 damage types in the game, each marked with a special color when mentioned (for increased visibility):</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="acid">acid</span> &mdash; refers to any type of corrosive substance</li>
  <li><span class="cold">cold</span> &mdash; is the numbing touch of frost</li>
  <li><span class="crsh">crushing</span> &mdash; blunt force trauma</li>
  <li><span class="fire">fire</span> &mdash; is flame or extreme heat</li>
  <li><span class="forc">force</span> &mdash; is raw magical energy, against which very few creatures have any sort of defense</li>
  <li><span class="elec">electricity</span> &mdash; known as lightning to the uneducated, it has a host of interesting properties wizards are only beginning to understand</li>
  <li><span class="necr">necrotic</span> &mdash; death energy from the Shadowfell</li>
  <li><span class="pier">piercing</span> &mdash; arrows, javelins and spears pierce the flesh</li>
  <li><span class="pois">poison</span> &mdash; biological substance that is harmful to most living creatures</li>
  <li><span class="psyc">psychic</span> &mdash; damage caused to the mind</li>
  <li><span class="slsh">slashing</span> &mdash; cutting damage, done by swords and axes</li>
  <li><span class="soni">sonic</span> &mdash; produced by a concussive burst of sound, it is uniquely suited to pierce even the thickest of armors</li>
</ul>
<h4>Facing</h4>
<p>Most creatures (exceptions must be explicitly noted) can only see (and therefore fight against) things in a front arc. By default, the front arc consists of all squares in front of, or to the side of, the character. The rest of the squares form the rear arc.</p>
<p>Facing is first determined when initiative is rolled. Afterwards, every time a character willingly moves, he can choose a new facing. A character can also spend his reaction to change his facing following another creature's movement.</p>
<p>A character can only target creatures in its front arc, and attacks made from its rear arc have advantage.</p>
<h4>A Character's Turn</h4>
<p>During its turn, a character can use these options in any order it wishes: move, action, bonus action. A turn represents a period of 6 seconds.</p>
<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>A character can move during its turn up to its maximum speed. Movement can be interspersed with actions and bonus actions in all possible permutations, so long as the character doesn't exceed its movement speed. If a character can attack twice, for example, it can move, attack, move, attack again, and still move if it has movement speed left.</p>
<p>If a character has several types of movement (eg. land and fly), it can switch between these two types at will. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is O or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>
<p>Movement can be diagonal, however it can't cross the corner of an obstacle that occupies it's entire square. Furthermore, every 3 diagonal moves cost an additional square.</p>
<p><b><i>Difficult terrain.</i></b> If terrain is classified as difficult (rubble, stairs, mud), then movement is twice as expensive (a meter counts as two). A space occupied by a creature always counts as difficult.</p>
<p><b><i>Prone.</i></b> You can drop prone for no cost. Standing up costs half of your movement speed, however. You can't stand up if you don't have enough speed remaining or if your speed is 0. While prone, you can move only through crawling, which costs an extra meter for every meter traversed (so in difficult terrain you spend 3m to move 1m).</p>
<p><b><i>Moving around other creatures.</i></b> It is permitted to move through squares occupied by friendly creatures. You can only move through a space occupied by a hostile creature if you are either larger, or two sizes smaller. You aren't allowed to willingly end your turn in an occupied space.</p>
<p><b><i>Forced into another creature's space.</i></b> If that creature is the same size or smaller, it must make a DC Dex 10. If it fails, the creature is pushed alongside the intruder. If it succeeds, it can choose whether to let the intruder pass through as if the creature isn't there (option changes to sliding into a free square if the intruder's movement ends in the creature's square), or stop the forced movement with a DC Str 10 + #squares intruder still has to traverse. On success, the intruder's movement stops; on failure, both creatures fall prone.</p>
<p>If the creature is larger than the intruder, it can choose to let the intruder move past or stop him (if the intruder would end up in a space occupied by the creature then the intruder is stopped).</p>
<p><b><i>Squeezing.</i></b> A creature can squeeze through a space that's sufficient for a creature one size smaller, but it counts as difficult terrain and it has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and attacks against its AC or DEX have advantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Flying movement.</i></b> If a flying creature is knocked prone, stunned, incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 or it otherwise loses its ability to stay in the air, then the creature falls to the ground, taking falling damage if appropriate. Creatures that hover don't suffer from this problem.</p>
<p><b><i>Creature size.</i></b> Tiny creatures control only a quarter of a square; therefore, up to four of them can occupy the same square at once. Small and medium creatures control a whole square. Large creatures control a 2x2 area, huge creatures 3x3, and gargantuan creatures 4x4 or, in rare cases, even more. At the GM's discretion, combat against a creature 2 sizes larger or more may follow special rules, such as requiring melee characters to climb their foe in order to be able to strike somewhere where it hurts.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>Unless special feats dictate otherwise, a character can only take one of these options during a turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Attack.</i></b> Make an attack with a weapon or natural ability of the character. Check the description of the attack you plan to use for information on how many attacks are permitted, the roll modifier, and the damage inflicted if the attack succeeds (a number of dice, which must be rolled).</p>
<p>For each attack that you make you can choose a different target. Furthermore, instead of using the attack as described, you can use one of the following alternatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grapple.</b> The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and he must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target; roll Force vs STR/DEX (whichever is higher). If you succeed, the target is <a href="conditions/grappled.html">grappled</a>. You can release the target as a free action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shove.</b> The enemy must be no more than one size larger than you, and he must be within your reach. Roll Force vs STR. If you succeed, you can either push the enemy 1 square away or knock him prone. You have advantage if you have the high ground (at least half a meter above your foe). You have disadvantage if the enemy has the high ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dual wielding.</b> Attack with a light melee or throwing weapon that you're holding in one hand, then use your bonus action to attack with a different light melee or throwing weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disarm.</b> Use your weapon to knock the enemy's weapon (or an object he might be holding) from his hands. Roll your weapon's attack (with disadvantage) against the enemy's STR/DEX (whichever is higher). If you are larger, you gain +2 to the disarm roll (per level of difference); if you are smaller, you're penalized by -2. Recovering the weapon is an action, and it can provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><b><i>Cast a spell.</i></b> See the spell description for the time it takes to cast the spell. Some spells use a bonus action, or a reaction, most require one action, while others consume actions over a certain number of rounds. See the <a href="#spellcasting">spellcasting</a> section for more information.</p>
<p><b><i>Dash.</i></b> Double your movement speed for this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Disengage.</i></b> Your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity on this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Dodge.</i></b> Until your next turn, attacks made against your AC or DEX have disadvantage. You lose this bonus if you are <a href="conditions/incapacitated.html">incapacitated</a> or your speed drops to 0.</p>
<p><b><i>Help.</i></b> You lend aid to an ally, providing it with advantage on a skill check, provided that your character has the ability to be of use. Alternatively, you can distract a foe (if at all possible), providing one ally with advantage on his first attack roll vs AC against that foe. This opportunity is only available until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Hide.</i></b> You can only use this option as long as you aren't in plain sight or only lightly obscured. Make a Stealth roll; all creatures with a Passive Perception lower than your roll can no longer see you. If one creature from a group spots you in hiding, it will shout out this information to all the others as soon as its turn comes up. You can still be heard and smelled while hiding; if you make a distinctive noise, or pass next to an enemy, then you must repeat your Stealth roll to continue fooling them.</p>
<p><b><i>Ready.</i></b> You prepare to take a reaction contingent on a trigger. You state what the trigger is ('the goblin moves on the trapdoor') and what your action will be ('I pull the trapdoor lever'). If the trigger occurs until the start of your next turn, you use your reaction to enact your statement. Note that if you already used a reaction this round, then you cannot react to the trigger.</p>
<p>If you're readying a spell this way, then your character is keeping it energized, ready to be released when the trigger occurs. This means maintaining <a href="#concentration">concentration</a>. If your concentration is broken, the spell is lost. Only spells that have a casting time of 1 action can be used in this way.</p>
<p><b><i>Use Object.</i></b> Interact with an object, like pulling lever, throwing a rock etc.</p>
<p><b><i>Improvise!</i></b> You can be creative and have your character do anything that is in his/her power to accomplish within the 6 seconds of a round.</p>
<h4>Bonus Actions</h4>
<p>Some abilities or spells require a bonus action. You can only take one bonus action during your turn. Its timing, however, is up to you.</p>
<h4>Free actions</h4>
<p>Simple actions, such as opening a door, unsheathing your sword, signaling your allies, or uttering a short phrase are free and can be done at any time during your turn.</p>
<h4>Reactions</h4>
<p>During your turn, you get one reaction, which is a short response to some trigger. Some abilities are employed during a reaction; the most common example is the attack of opportunity. The Ready action also makes use of the reaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Opportunity attack.</i></b> If you move out of an opponents melee reach, then that opponent can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack on you (following the rules of a regular melee attack). You don't provoke an opportunity attack if you are moved by an external force (such as a shove, or an explosion), because it's too sudden a movement for the average opponent to react to it.</p>
<h4>Ranged attacks</h4>
<p><b><i>Range.</i></b> If a ranged attack has a single distance noted, you can't attack targets beyond this range. If there are two distances, the smaller number is the normal range and the other is the long range, beyond which you can't attack. If you attack targets beyond the normal range, you roll with disadvantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Ranged weapons in melee.</i></b> If you are within a square of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, then your ranged attack rolls have disadvantage.</p>
<h4>Cover</h4>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies. Cover bonuses don't apply to area of effect spells, provided that the cover doesn't stand between the creature and the center of the effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Half cover.</i></b> Provides +2 to AC and DEX defense. A target has half cover if an obstacle covers at least half of its body.</p>
<p><b><i>Three-quarters cover.</i></b> Provides +5 to AC and DEX defebse. A target has 3/4 cover if an obstacle covers at least 3/4 of its body. Standing behind a creature your size counts as 3/4 cover.</p>
<p><b><i>Full cover.</i></b> Can't be targeted directly by ranged attacks or spells. A target has full cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>
<h4>Damage resistance and vulnerability</h4>
<p>If a creature has <b>resistance</b> to a damage type, then damage from that source is halved. Conversely, <b>vulnerability</b> doubles damage from that source. This multiplier is applied only after all other damage modifiers have already been added. You can't stack resistance nor vulnerability to a damage type.</p>
<h4>Falling to 0 hp</h4>
<p>Whenever you fall to 0 hp, you immediately fall <a href="conditions/unconscious.html">unconscious</a>. When brought to 0 hp, if there is damage remaining that equals or exceeds your max hp, then you die instantly.</p>
<p>Each turn you start at 0 hp, you must make a death saving throw: if the roll of a d20 is 10 or higher, you gain a success, otherwise you gain a failure. Three failures means you die, while three successes means you stabilize. A stable creature remains unconscious, but is in no danger of dying (unless it takes damage again) and will regain 1hp after 1d4 hours (thus becoming conscious again).</p>
<p>If you roll a 20 on a death saving throw, you gain 1 hp (thus immediately regaining consciousness). If you roll a 1, it counts as two failures.</p>
<p>If you take damage while unconscious, you gain a death save failure. If you take a critical hit, you gain two failures. If the damage equals or exceeds your max hp, you immediately die.</p>
<p>A creature can be stabilized with a DC 10 Medicine.</p>
<h4>Knocking a creature out</h4>
<p>When an attacker reduces an opponent to 0 hp with a melee attack, it can choose to knock out the target, which then falls unconscious and is stable.</p>
<h4>Temporary hit points</h4>
<p>Temporary hp is separate from normal hp. It can't be healed by any means, it doesn't stack (so if you are affected by two boons providing temporary hp, you must choose one of them) and it is always the first to absorb damage. If you have 0 hp, then temporary hp doesn't restore you to consciousness, nor does it stabilize you; it only helps absorb damage while in that state.</p>
<p>Unless the feature that granted you temporary hp has a duration, they last until they are depleted or until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Vulnerable body part</h4>
<p>Foes may have some body part that is both important to combat functions and quite vulnerable. For example, humanoid creatures have arms and legs that, if cut off, impair their combat capacity. The heart, or head, while definitely of supreme importance, are however not vulnerable, as they are always the best defended parts of a body (unless otherwise specified).</p>
<p>A creature can specifically target such a body part, with a disadvantage on the attack roll. The attack deals damage to both the body part and the body itself. If the creature is healed, then it can choose to also apply that healing on a damaged body part. If not otherwise specified, the body part defaults to a quarter of the health of the body. If the body part is reduced to 0hp then it is destroyed, and cannot be healed through ordinary means; furthermore, all abilities granted by that body part are immediately lost.</p>
<p>Vulnerable parts are usually specified in a monster's description, but the GM can accept improvisation on this front if it makes sense. For example, all humanoids rely on their right arm to fight; if destroyed, they may attempt to fight with their left (if at all possible), but at a disadvantage, and only after picking up their weapon. If a leg is destroyed, then movement speed is halved. If both legs are destroyed, then the creature is stuck in prone (this stacks with the halved movement speed).</p>
<h4 id="creature_intel">Creature intelligence</h4>
<p>A creature's intelligence belongs to one of four rough categories: mindless, instinctive, clever and sentient. This division is mostly about communication, but it also determines the behavior of those creatures.</p>
<p>A <b>mindless</b> creature has no will of its own, and it will merely carry out its instructions to the best of its ability. It cannot communicate in any way (except perhaps to blurt out a message programmed into it) and it cannot adapt to circumstances it hasn't been prepared for. This doesn't make it dumb, but merely rigid in its actions.</p>
<p>A creature with <b>instinctive</b> intelligence relies on its instincts and its experience in its actions. Most animals in the wild have instinctive intelligence. They can communicate in very primitive ways, but only about tangible things (food, shelter, threats) and simple emotions like fear or anger. Even this limited communication can only be realized in its fullest extent with the help of magic.</p>
<p>A <b>clever</b> creature is not yet fully sentient, but very nearly so. It can learn fairly complex patterns and actions, and can understand a wide array of concepts, even some slightly abstract ones. Cats, dogs and dolphins are examples of clever creatures.</p>
<p>A <b>sentient</b> creature is capable of thinking about itself and about the most abstract of concepts. There is a wide range of variance in the intelligence of sentients, how much they can understand and how well they can plan, but all sentients can communicate in at least one language in the fullest sense of the word.</p>
<h4>Morale</h4>
<p>Morale is an indicator for the GM to keep in mind during battles, the likelihood for the losing side to cut their losses and flee. Note that intelligent and well-organized adversaries might enact a fighting retreat, whose aim is to secure a better tactical position - this is very different to a full-on retreat, or a panicked rout. It is up to the GM to decide if and in what manner a creature or group will flee. The morale rating only roughly describes how likely it is for a rout to happen, and how panicked it is likely to be. After all, much depends on the specific circumstances, such as how badly the creatures are losing and what their goals in the fight are. Creatures fighting to defend their offspring will generally fight to the death, for example.</p>
<p>Sentient creatures may also offer to surrender, but only if they believe it will be accepted and honored. Surrender is more likely when retreat is difficult or impossible, when it has been formally offered, and particularly if the creatures are of the same species with some of their attackers.</p>
<p>Mindless creatures do not have morale and they will follow their orders regardless of how severe the consequences. More intelligent creatures, however, have one of six ratings: cowardly, hesitant, firm, brave, fanatic, and heroic.</p>
<p><b>Cowardly</b> creatures are easily cowed by displays of power (such as high-level spells, environment-shaping effects, or even outright intimidation), by the loss of a leader, or by grievous injuries. They don't have the stomach for fights not in their favor, although they may fight on out of a sick pleasure to inflict pain on others. They value their own skin far more than that of their allies and they will always rout in disorganized manner, sometimes even while other allies fight on. They will also prefer ranged weapons over melee whenever possible. If routed, they are unlikely to rally any time soon, unless forced to by a leader. Goblins are the archetypal cowardly creature.</p>
<p><b>Hesitant</b> creatures aren't terribly motivated to fight, but will continue to do so for as long as defeat doesn't seem inevitable. As long as a leader they fear or respect is in sight they will keep fighting, at least as long as there isn't a more fearful force in opposition. They have some respect for the lives of others, and so their retreats will sometimes be more organized.</p>
<p><b>Firm</b> creatures are akin to regular soldiers. They will fight on bravely until it is clear that the fight is lost. Even then, they will continue holding the line if a leader is present. Their retreats are seldom panicked routs, and they may even rally on their own if the enemy isn't chipping at their heels.</p>
<p><b>Brave</b> creatures are proud or elite warriors, who will rarely flee, and even then certainly not in a disorganized manner. They will never abandon allies or a leader, even under the most dire circumstances, and they will never drop their weapons when retreating. They will rally as soon as feasible and seek to fulfill their goals.</p>
<p><b>Fanatic</b> creatures are like men who have nothing to lose, or religious zealots and they behave almost like mindless creatures. They will plunge into peril almost heedless of danger and fight to the death unless specifically commanded otherwise by their superior. Fanatics always have someone or something they believe unquestioningly in.</p>
<p><b>Heroic</b> creatures will fight unwaveringly in pursuit of their goal, but will not die foolishly. If they can achieve their goal just as well (or better) by retreating or surrendering, they will do so.</p>
<p>The leader of a group (if one even exists) is at the GM's discretion. Generally, it will be the strongest creature in the group. If an encounter group consists of different races, it is also possible to have different leaders for each one.</p>
<h4>Mounted combat</h4>
<p>To mount or dismount, you need to spend half of your movement points (this is impossible to do if your speed is 0).</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will, or it would knock you prone while mounted, then you must succeed on a DC Acrobatics 10 or be knocked off the mount, landing prone in a square next to it.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land gracefully in a square next to it. Otherwise, you fall prone in a square next to the mount.</p>
<p>If the mount is intelligent, then it acts independently (although, of course, it can coordinate with its rider if it is so inclined). It has its own spot in the initiative order, and its possibilities are in no way limited by the rider on its back (within the limits of common decency). Conversely, a domesticated and trained mount will act during your turn, with one of these actions: Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.</p>
<p>If a mount provokes an attack of opportunity, then the enemy can attack either you or your mount.</p>
<h4>Underwater combat</h4>
<p>When a creature without swimming speed makes a melee attack with a weapon other than a dagger, short sword, javelin, spear or trident, it suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls.</p>
<p>A ranged attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even within the normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless it's a crossbow, a net, or a javelin (or thrown spear or dart).</p>
<p>Fully submerged creatures have resistance to fire damage.</p>
<h4>Combat against mobs</h4>
<p>Some foes are so outmatched that only sheer numbers can hope to even the scales in their favor. In order to ease bookkeeping in such situations, these foes are handled as a mob.</p>
<p>The mob moves and acts all at once, and it can occupy several squares (loosen the restriction for one Medium creature per square if needed). Damage is applied to the mob as a whole, and several individuals can be killed with one attack. When attacking, determine the d20 roll an individual creature would need to hit. If it's 1-5, apply damage for every individual in the mob; if 6-12, for every 2; if 13-14, for every 3; if 15-16, for every 4; if 17-18, for every 5; if 19, for every 10; if 20, for every 20.</p>
<h4>Instant kills</h4>
<p>If an enemy is unable to defend himself and you are armed with a lethal melee weapon, then you can kill him instantly, without any checks. A sleeping target can be killed instantly with just a Stealth check, rolled with advantage, against the target's Passive Perception. Targets who are completely at ease (unaware there is a foe around) can also be instantly killed with a Stealth check against the target's Passive Perception (this is separate from the check to Hide; and in this case you receive no advantages from being obscured or invisible).</p>
<h4 id="socialInteract">Social Interaction</h4>
<p>It may be the case that the person you're interacting with has objections to helping you out. If that's the case, then the PCs must somehow overcome these objections (convince the person).</p>
<p>The NPC starts with one or more objections, each with a score assigned, defining how strong the objection is. To surpass these objections, the PCs must either address an objection (thus lowering its score) OR provide an incentive to help. The better the argument, the greater the score it has. But to carry this argument across, a PC has to rely on Persuasion or Intimidation (the latter can only be used to provide an incentive of fear – although it is only useful when the person being threatened has something to fear from the PCs). Both sides may employ falsehood or misinformation in the discussion (if you're convinced a false statement is true, it's not lying). In this case, success is determined by a contest of Deception vs Insight.</p>
<p>The NPC is convinced if the score of the incentives equals or surpasses the score of the objections. However, particularly bad arguments or discovered lies can instead increase the strength of objections; a character may choose to end the conversation if the objections become too strong or if the conversation stalls for too long. Also, if the PCs make a particularly offensive remark and it isn't addressed promptly and satisfactorily (if it is even possible), then the conversation also ends.</p>
<p>Some characters may have particular likes or dislikes, which can produce an advantage or disadvantage in the ability checks. For example, a knight might be flattered with praise of his honor and fighting skills, or a racist dwarf might dislike talking to elves.</p>
<p>Some characters may hold to an objection fanatically, thus it's score cannot be lowered by any argument. (For example, a priest is probably fanatically convinced of the philosophy of his Deity) Thus, the only way to convince such a person is to provide matching incentives.</p>
<p>If the conversation is such that small talk is appropriate, then a contest of Insight vs Deception can provide the party with some information on a character's objections.</p>


<br/><h1 id="exploration">Exploration</h1>
<p>Exploration lacks the quick pace and tension of combat, though sudden surprises and setbacks can happen. It generally covers a timespan measured in tens of minutes. Players will generally spend a few minutes on an individual task, or they may be moving from scene to scene during exploration, as in exploring a dungeon complex, or they may be playing out an extended single scene, such as stealthily infiltrating an enemy stronghold.</p>
<h4>Exploration actions</h4>
<p>As is normal, once a player declares an action, the GM determines whether the action can succeed or fail and determines whether an ability check is required. The GM should also determine whether the action is immediate and also whether the action is quiet or noisy. If the description of the action doesn’t make that obvious, the GM should ask questions of the player to determine those answers.</p>
<p>If the action is immediate, the action is resolved on the spot, using the Core Mechanic. If the action was loud, the GM <a href="#complications">Rolls for Complications</a>. Arguing loudly over the course of action counts as a loud, non-immediate action.</p>
<p>If the action is not immediate, however, the GM should let the other players know that the character is engaged in an action that will take a few minutes and ask what the other players are doing during this time. This should be done before the non-immediate action is resolved. If any players undertake immediate actions at this point or ask questions, they should be dealt with immediately. If any players declare actions that aren’t immediate, those actions should be held. Once all the players are committed to non-immediate actions or to waiting for their allies to finish their tasks, the GM should resolve each non-immediate task in turn and then <a href="#advanceTime">Advance Time</a>. If any of the actions were loud, the GM should <a href="#complications">Roll for Complications</a>.</p>
<p><i>Example: The party enters an ancient study. There is a book chained to a lectern in the middle of the room, an ancient desk, and a bookshelf filled with aging books. Unbeknownst to the party, there is also a strongbox sitting on the floor behind the desk. Any player in the vicinity of the desk will notice it immediately. Alice says, “I want to go check out that book on the lectern.” The GM explains that it is a leather-bound book, aged, but intact. The cover has a padlock, locking it closed, and it is secured via a chain to the lectern. Alice wants to investigate the book further. The GM asks what she means. She says she suspects the book might be protected by a trap of some kind. She’d like to be sure it’s safe before she tries to unlock it. The GM says “that will take several minutes, okay? While Alice is doing that, what do the rest of you do?” Bob says he’d like to go over an examine the desk. The GM says “as you approach the desk, you notice a metal strong-box on the floor beside it. It is closed with a padlock.” Bob says “I want to try to pry open the padlock with my crowbar.” The GM nods and says “that will also take a few minutes. You can do that while Alice is looking for traps.” Carol says, “I’m just going to keep watch.” Dave says, “I’ll go look through the books on the bookshelf. I’ll see if I can find anything valuable or unusual.” Now that Alice, Bob, and Dave are committed to non-immediate actions and Carol is waiting for them to finish, the GM can resolve each action in turn. The GM determines that none of the actions are loud. The GM Advances Time and then resolves each of the actions in turn. And then asks the party what they want to do next.</i></p>
<h4>Extended Tasks</h4>
<p>In general, an exploration task should take no longer than ten minutes. However, some very complicated tasks can take an extended period of time. The GM can determine, for example, that an extremely complex, ancient lock might take longer to pick. During that time, the party might attract attention and complications may arise.</p>
<p>When designing an extended task, a GM should determine how much time the task requires in terms of actions. Each action Advances Time once and, if the action is noisy, may cause a Roll for Complications. Obviously, during this time, other characters may engage in actions as described above or they can simply wait. If the action does not require a die roll, the GM merely Advances Time for each required action and, if necessary, Rolls for Complications. If the action does require a die roll, the GM Advances Time and Rolls for Complications for each action as normal, but if the die roll is a failure, the character makes no progress. Thus, they may have to attempt further actions in order to complete the task. Of course, if the action takes too long, the party may decide to give up. Particularly if complications arise.</p>
<h4>Time Pool</h4>
<p>The Time Pool is an approximation of the time that elapses as the party partakes in lengthy actions. The Time Pool is a pile of 0 to 5 tokens that is visible to all the players and the GM. Each token in the pool indicates that 10 minutes of game time have passed.</p>
<p id="advanceTime">Whenever the party is engaged in one or more non-instantaneous exploration tasks as described above, or whenever they move from location to location within the dungeon, or whenever they engage in an activity that takes between one and ten minutes (such as casting a spell as a ritual), the GM Advances Time. The GM may also Advance Time if the party is staying in one place debating their actions for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>When Time Advances, any effect with 10 minutes or less remaining of its duration expires. Other durations are not effected. The GM then adds a single token to the Time Pool. If multiple characters undertook simultaneous exploration tasks, the GM adds only a single token to the Time Pool. However, the GM does not add a token to the Time Pool if there are already five tokens in the Time Pool. Instead, the Time Pool is <a href="#timepoolClear">Cleared</a>.</p>
<h4 id="complications">Rolling for Complications</h4>
<p>Elements of the adventure could also call for a Roll for Complications as determined by the GM or the adventure designer. For example, if the party sets off an alarm trap or if a goblin prisoner starts screaming for help, the adventure could call on the GM to Roll for Complications.</p>
<p>To Roll for Complications, the GM rolls a number of dice equal to the number of tokens currently in the Time Pool. In most normal situations, the GM will roll d6s. However, in less dangerous or more sparsely populated environments, the GM could use d8s. And in extremely dangerous environments, the GM could use d4s.</p>
<p>Various factors in the adventure could change the size of the dice used when Rolling for Complications. For example, if the party invades a kobold lair during the day – when most of the kobolds are sleeping – the Complication Dice might only be d8s. But if they come back at night, those dice become d6s. And if some kobolds manage to escape from a battle and raise the alarm, those dice might become d4s. Again, GMs and adventure designers are encouraged to use the Complication mechanic creatively to add different elements to their adventures.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number and size of the Complication Dice, if any die shows a 1, a Complication occurs. The GM should remove one token from the Time Pool and then resolve the Complication. Otherwise, nothing happens.</p>
<p>If the GM is ever required to Roll for Complications when there are no tokens in the Time Pool, the GM should roll one Complication Die. If it shows a 1, a Complication arises. Otherwise, nothing happens.</p>
<h4>Complications</h4>
<p>A Complication is a random event, setback, or encounter that befalls the party. They are prescribed by the adventure, but the GM can invent new ones on the fly. The most common Complications are random encounters with creatures wandering around the dungeon. In general, such an encounter should be an encounter of Easy difficulty for the party’s level or even easier. Such encounters should be nuisances rather than serious threats. Complications should never reward players with any XP.</p>
<p>Wandering creatures do not have to be hostile, though outright friendly creatures should be exceedingly rare. Other random events can include geological events, minor traps and hazards that risk a few hit points of damage or impose a condition on an unlucky PC, or the like.</p>
<p>GMs or adventure designers are welcome to design whatever Complications serve the theme of the adventure. But Complications should not be terribly complex. A random encounter should include only one or two types of creatures with clear, simple motivations. Other random events should not be more complex than a single event that the party can react to. In general, for each adventuring day that the GM or designer expects the party to spend exploring the site, there should be at least four but no more than six possible Complications. They could be organized on a random table or the GM can simply choose an appropriate one.</p>
<p>Specific locations can also have specific Complications keyed to them. For example, in the cave of sulfurous geysers, a Complication can always result in a spray of noxious gases from one of the geysers. An adventure designer could also instruct a GM to Roll for Complications each time the party passes through the Sulfurous Geyser Cave. Complications and Rolls for Complications should be used in this way to create special effects that help bring a dungeon to life and all sorts of random events can key off of this system.</p>
<h4 id="timepoolClear">Clearing the Time Pool</h4>
<p>After all effects with 10 minutes or less remaining of their durations expires as normal for Advancing Time, any effect with an hour or less remaining of its duration expires. Any effect with a duration greater than one hour remaining has one hour subtracted from its remaining duration. Then, the GM Rolls for Complications regardless of whether any attempted actions were loud or rushed. The GM should only roll six dice and not add any for the final advancement of time that caused the Time Pool to clear. Whether a Complication occurs or not, the GM then removes all tokens from the Time Pool.</p>
<h4>Short Rest</h4>
<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend available Hit Dice at the end of a short rest. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hp equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.</p>
<p>The Time Pool remains untouched after a Short Rest, but the GM will Roll for Complications with six dice.</p>
<h4>Long Rest</h4>
<p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity (reading, talking, eating, or standing watch) for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, all tokens are cleared from the Time Pool (but this doesn't trigger a <a href="#timepoolClear">Clear</a>). After a Long Rest, a character regains all lost hp. The character also regains half of its maximum Hit Dice (but can't exceed this maximum). A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hp at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
<h4>Long Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can jump over 4m + 0.5m * STR. If you make a standing jump, then you can clear only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. If the landing is contested by an enemy, roll Acrobatics (DEX) vs enemy DEX defense.</p>
<h4>Height Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can leap into the air 1m + 0.25m * STR. If you make a standing jump, then you can leap only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. Since you jump with your hands up, you can reach a ledge as high as jump height + 1.5 * character height.</p>
<h4>Marching Order</h4>
<p>The party must, at all times, have a well established marching order (the formation in which the characters march). When going through tight spaces, the marching order may have to change. The party must establish a default marching order (including who takes point if the situation demands it) and announce changes if and when it is deemed necessary. This is so that the GM doesn't have to ask for a marching order when it's needed, thus potentially tipping off the party than an encounter or trap is imminent.</p>
<h4>Vision and light</h4>
<p><b><i>Lightly obscured.</i></b> An area in dim light, fog, or covered with foliage. Characters trying to see something located in such an area have disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight.</p>
<p><b><i>Heavily obscured.</i></b> An area is not in the line of sight, or is covered in darkness or thick fog. Characters in such an area are effectively <a href="conditions/blinded.html">blind</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Bright light.</i></b> Most creatures can see clearly. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns and fires, within a specific radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Dim light.</i></b> Also called shadow, is a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn, or a particularly brilliant full moon also count as dim light.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkness</i></b> creates a heavily obscured area. The absence of light sources (moonlight doesn't count) creates darkness.</p>
<p><b><i>Blindsight.</i></b> The creature can perceive the environment without sight, in the given radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> The creature treats darkness as if it were dim light, although it can't distinguish colors.</p>
<p><b><i>Truesight.</i></b> A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions (thus being immune to any effects from them), and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<h4>Nourishment</h4>
<p>A character needs half a kg of food per day and can go without food for a period equal to 3 + minim(CON, 1) days. For every subsequent day without food, the character takes one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>A character needs to drink 2 liters of water (or an appropriate substitute) per day, or 4 liters if the weather is hot. If a character drinks only half the required water, DC 15 Athletics (CON) or take a level of exhaustion. If even less water is available, then the character automatically takes a level of exhaustion, two if the character is already exhausted.</p>
<p>For every size above Medium, a character consumes twice as much food and water. A Tiny character's consumption is halved, on the other hand.</p>


<br/><h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>
<p>During travel, the characters are moving from place to play over an extended period. They choose actions that may cover hours or even days of game time and they generally keep to them until something happens.</p>
<h4>Traveling through wilderness</h4>
<p>The world of D&amp;D is a dangerous one, and travel often involves great peril for the party, even more so in wilderness, where there is a danger of getting lost or low on food after days of wandering. The following rules only apply in situations where there is a significant risk of hostile encounters, or of a comparable loss of resources.</p>
<p>For any travel, the following factors are determined by the GM: Danger, Navigation, Resources and Discoveries. These factors can be gleaned by the players from research or interactions with NPCs, but will never be explicitly stated. Note that these factors need not be constant for the whole trip. The gentle meadow might give way to a treacherous forest filled with goblins.</p>
<p><b><i>Danger.</i></b> An estimate of how many random encounters are expected in a day of travel. It is 1 for regions regularly policed by a civilized faction or barren locations with few creatures; 2 for untamed wilderness; 3 for enemy territory (inhabited by intelligent and hostile creatures); 4 for regularly patrolled enemy territory; 5 for territory filled with monsters that can easily detect intruders and are actively trying to stop them (this is reserved for the most extreme of environments, such as Hell).</p>
<p><b><i>Navigation.</i></b> A measure of how difficult it is to find and follow landmarks. It will be used as DC, and so it ranges from 0 to 30 (or beyond in rare, extreme circumstances). If the party must follow a road, or a river, this is 0, but if it must navigate a treacherous desert, it is instead 30.</p>
<p><b><i>Resources.</i></b> A measure of how difficult it is to forage for food and water. It will be used as a DC, and so it ranges from 0 in lush river lands, to 30 in deserts, to 99 in environments that are completely barren.</p>
<p><b><i>Discovery.</i></b> The chance to stumble across something interesting in the distance, that the party might want to explore. A discovery generally contains some reward for the party.</p>
<p><b><i>Pace.</i></b> At the beginning of each day, the party must decide at what pace to travel: slow, normal or fast. This decision can be revisited at any point, affecting the total traveled for the day accordingly. At a slow pace, a party travels only 2/3 the normal distance, but it moves stealthily and carefully, providing them with advantage on Perception and Navigation checks; conversely, enemies suffer disadvantage on Perception checks to spot the party. At a normal pace the party suffers disadvantage on Forage checks. At a fast pace, the party has no possibility to forage, it suffers disadvantage on Perception and Navigation checks and enemies have advantage on Perception checks to spot the party.</p>
<p>At the beginning of every day of travel, the GM secretly rolls six d6, one for every time of day: morning, afternoon, evening, dusk, midnight, predawn. For each one that shows the Danger number or less, an encounter <i>might</i> happen. The GM also rolls another d6; if it is equal or lower to the Discovery number, a tantalizing opportunity will present itself during the day.</p>
<p>Now, for each encounter that might happen, check for who spots whom and run it accordingly. Since neither party might notice the other, it is possible for such an encounter to not happen at all. Encounters need not be battles; they can also be traps, puzzles, interesting choices etc. A short rest is always assumed to have happened before encounters.</p>
<p>Once the encounters for daytime (morning to dusk) are done, the party sets camp to get some sleep. They can also set camp sooner, but that would waste what remains of the day. The party can also choose to press on without setting camp and thus increase the distance traveled by half, but they immediately take a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>When the day ends, the GM does the bookkeeping for the previous day. First, determine if the party is lost by rolling (in secret) with the bonuses of the best navigator against the Navigation DC. Failure means the party is lost (they just don't know it yet). If the party isn't lost, register the amount traveled during the day as progress (no progress otherwise). Progress, as well as travel time, is measured in days. If the party spent some time on a discovery, subtract an appropriate number from their progress (usually 1/3).</p>
<p>If lost, a subsequent successful Navigation roll will reveal that the party has been lost (and for how long). Progress will be accumulated once again. At the GM's discretion, the party might get lost in a certain direction and therefore encounter certain features on the map. Under a more meticulous system, being lost adds progress in a different direction, thus necessitating a new calculation for travel time.</p>
<p>After logging progress, everyone rolls for forage (unless the party traveled at a fast pace). Characters that failed have to consume one ration for the day. If the whole party fails to forage, then the personal water reserves aren't replenished. Note that extra water reserves the party might have are only replenished if there are significant bodies of water in the environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the night time encounters play out. Assume everyone keeps watch for equal amounts of time and roll randomly to see who is awake. If the enemy spots the camp, then the awake character must succeed on a Perception check to avoid an ambush.</p>
<h4>Falling</h4>
<p>When a creature falls, it takes <span class="crsh">1d6 crushing damage</span> for every 3m of descent, up to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it has avoided damage from falling.</p>
<h4>Magic Items</h4>
<p>In order to learn what a magic item does, the most reliable way is to cast an <i>Identify</i> spell on it (either yourself, or by hiring the services of a local wizard). The other option is to spend a short rest investigating the item (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). You roll a DC Perception 12 (certain artifacts might require more). If you fail, you learn nothing, though you can always try again later. If you succeed, then you learn the item's properties, except for those that aren't readily apparent (subtle curses, long-term effects, or the personality quirks of the item, if it's intelligent - though you can glean it's alignment; all these properties only become apparent after you bond with the item).</p>
<p>In order to use a magic item, you must bond with it, which means spending a short rest, concentrating on the item, uninterrupted (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). Once this is done, you can access all of the item's properties (as well as its downsides...).</p>
<p>An item can be bonded to only one creature at a time. A creature cannot bond with two magic items of the same type (eg two magical swords) at any given time, and you can bond to only one item during a short rest.</p>
<p>Your bond to an item ends when the item has been more than 100m away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your bond to an item with another short rest. Some items, however, are cursed and cannot be relinquished without completing some special requirements first, that depend on the nature of the curse.</p>


<br/><h1 id="downtime">Down Time</h1>
<p>Down time can cover hours or even days of activity. The party is generally not engaged in immediate activities and tend to be focused on long-term tasks such as crafting, research, training, building reputations, or carousing.</p>


<br/><h1 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h1>
<p>The magic performed by mortals is tightly bound by arbitrary rules that few understand and none can avoid. A spell does nothing more and nothing less that what it says in its description. Therefore, while magic can certainly be used in creative ways, a spell can never do more than what it is defined to do.</p>
<p>To cast a spell, one requires the use of his/her voice and a free hand in order to speak the words of power and channel the magic to its target. If a caster is gagged, silenced, or has his hands bound tightly to his body or occupied with objects, then he/she cannot perform magic.</p>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell.</p>
<p>The effects of the same spell don't overlap if the spell is cast multiple times on the same target. Different spells can overlap, however.</p>
<h4>Spell slots</h4>
<p>Excepting a select few characters that posses the ability of innate spellcasting, everyone needs to spend a spell slot of an equal or higher level to the spell one desires to cast. Cantrips, or 0 level spells, are an exception to this rule, as they are so easy, and so well practiced by the magic user, that they can be employed at will.</p>
<p>A spell always assumes the level of the slot used to cast it. A spell may thus assume a higher level and become more powerful (consult the spell's description for specifics).</p>
<p>Some spells can be cast as a ritual, provided that they have the ritual tag in their description. In this form, the spell takes 10 minutes per level to cast, but it doesn't consume a spell slot (this, however, means that a ritual spell's level can't be increased). The magic user needs a special trait in order to cast rituals and, unless specified otherwise, the caster needs to have the spell prepared (check class description for specifics on spell preparing).</p>
<h4 id="epicRitual">Epic Ritual</h4>
<p>Certain powerful magics (imprisoning very powerful entities, opening a permanent gateway to another plane of existence) can only be worked through epic rituals, which require a tremendous amount of power and preparation to be cast. Epic rituals are considered to be level 10 spells, thus impossible to cast by ordinary means. The caster must have a trait allowing him/her to cast an epic ritual, and all his spell slots must be intact. It takes 2 hours to perform such a ritual, and at its end the caster expends all of his spell slots.</p>
<h4>Material Components</h4>
<p>Some spells require rare (and expensive) materials, which are are not consumed during the casting unless the spell description notes otherwise. If a component is consumed, it is reduced to very fine dust as its powers are absorbed into the spell. A spellcaster needs a free hand to use material components, but this is assumed to be the hand used to draw the gestures required for the spell.</p>
<h4>Spell Scrolls</h4>
<p>A spell scroll is a thick parchment imbued with magical power, bearing a few arcane symbols that must be activated to unleash the spell within. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to activate the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components or a spell slot. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.</p>
<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must roll spellpower to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + spell's level. On a failed check, scroll turns to dust with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the scroll turns to dust.</p>
<p>The creation of a spell scroll is an expensive and time-consuming process, where the slightest error can derail the whole process. An Arcana check is required to successfully craft a scoll. If the check fails, then the money and time are wasted regardless. The cost is detailed in the table below (it does not include the required material components, which must be provided at creation), as are the spellpower values for the spell. These values don't depend on the caster, for the spell magic is imbued into the scroll.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>Rarity</th><th>Spellpower</th><th>Craft Cost</th><th>Arcana DC to craft</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Common</td><td>+3</td><td>250 gg, 1 day</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>+4</td><td>500 gg, 2 days</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>+5</td><td>1 GK, 3 days</td><td>13</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Legendary</td><td>+10</td><td>64 GK, 20 days</td><td>24</td></tr>
</table>
<br/><h4 id="concentration">Concentration</h4>
<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
<p>The following situations remove a spellcaster's concentration: casting another spell that requires concentration, casting a spell whose casting time is longer than one action or being incapacitated or killed. When taking damage, the spellcaster must succeed on DC Con [max(10, damage/2)] to maintain his concentration. At the GM's discretion, certain stressful situations may impose a DC Con 10 to maintain concentration.</p>
<h4>Area of effect</h4>
<p>Spells with an area of effect have a point of origin and a shape along which the effect manifests itself. If there's an obstacle that provides full cover between a creature and the point of origin, that creature is safe from the effects of the spell. When playing on squares, a spell affects a square provided that its area of effect overlaps half of more of that square.</p>
<p><b><i>Cone.</i></b> A cone's width at any point is equal to the distance to its point of origin, which isn't included in the area of effect, unless you decide so. When playing on squares, a row at distance N from the point of origin is affected on a width of N (if N is odd) or N-1 (if N is even). (Other fractions of squares are also technically affected, but any creature in such a square has plenty of space to dodge)</p>
<p><b><i>Cube.</i></b> The point of origin lies on the side of the cube and isn't included in the area of effect unless you decide so.</p>
<p><b><i>Cylinder.</i></b> The point of origin lies at the base of the cylinder and is included in the area of effect. The cylinder has a radius, as well as height.</p>
<p><b><i>Sphere.</i></b> The sphere extends outwards from its point of origin. Unless the character specifically mentions otherwise (and the spell allows it), the sphere's center is considered to lie on the ground. Thus, its area of effect will be that of a circle with the sphere's radius.</p>
<h4>Schools of Magic</h4>
<p>In the oldest days of recorded history, magicians agreed that spells should be categorized according to the level upon which it acted: Materium (the physical world), Aetherium (energy) or Aidos (the mind, the soul and the other highest concepts that could not be readily explained). They then further divided magic according to its source of power. More recently, however, ingenious archmages have proved that, at least empirically, there is no measurable difference in the effects of magic that depend on its source. Therefore, a new classification was adopted, based solely on what the spell affects and what the end result is.</p>
<p>While stubborn hold-outs remain, especially among clerics, who like to imagine that their divine magic is somehow better, the vast majority of the scholars agree that magic can be neatly divided into eight schools:</p>
<p><b><i>Abjuration</i></b> spells are sometimes called anti-magic, since its most important use is to cancel other magic or stop its effects. It is a category of protective spells, that can create magical barriers, remove harmful magics, stop trespassers, or banish creatures to their home plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>Animancy</i></b> deals with the mysterious energies of life and death (biotic and necrotic energy, which stand in opposition to one another). Such spells can heal as well as harm, transfer life energy from a creature to another, resurrect the dead, or even animate their corpses using the forces of death. While massively helpful, some cultures consider parts of it or even the entire field as taboo, since it manipulates forces some consider are not meant for the mortals to tamper with. Necromancy in particular, meaning the use of necrotic energy, is shunned or outright banned in most of the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Conjuration</i></b> spells involve the creation and destruction of matter in all its forms. Most often it is used to create useful objects, harmful materials that can be thrown or dropped on enemies, to summon helpful creatures, but it can also be used to unmake and remake an object in different places, thus providing an instantaneous mode of travel. Conjuration deals exclusively with the Materium.</p>
<p><b><i>Divination</i></b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. It works in Aidos, particularly in the areas over which mortals have yet gleaned little knowledge. As such, it is the least understood and least appreciated of the schools of magic.</p>
<p><b><i>Noumancy</i></b> is all about the mind (Nous) and thoughts. Also called mind magic or enchantment by those less inclined to academic terms, it covers spells that affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Needless to say, its use is highly controversial and highly regulated if not outright banned in many civilizations. Less scrupulous wizards often hide behind the academic term as a means to lessen scrutiny from those less informed.</p>
<p><b><i>Protomancy</i></b> spells create and manipulate energy, either in its direct form or refined as fire, frost or lightning. While there are some peaceful applications of this energy, it is most often employed in the utter destruction of one's enemies, with bolts, beams or exploding balls. Protomancy is spectacular and often the first thing people associate with magic, but it is also dangerous to those who do not tread carefully with its power.</p>
<p><b><i>Umbramancy</i></b> is the art of controlling the energies of Shadow and Light, one drawn from the Moon, the other drawn from the Sun. Umbramantic spells hold great sway over sight, and some lesser power over sound. They cause people to see things that aren't there or to hear phantom noises, or they obscure or warp their perception of reality. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious spells manipulate the very sight of a creature so that it is completely ruptured from reality. Despite the bad name it gets, Umbramancy is equally powerful with the Light, and it can also be used to unburden sight of the thickest veils.</p>
<p><b><i>Transmutation</i></b> spells alter the properties of a substance that already exists, ranging from simple or subtle changes to those that make the original barely recognizable. They might transform a creature into a different one, bolster or sap the abilities of a creature, apply forces on an object to make it move or twist, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>


<br/><h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>
<h4>Coinage</h4>
<p>Generally, every realm has its own form of currency, sometimes not even employing precious metal coins. However, coins are well received everywhere, except in cases where one tries to pay with the currency of a hostile power, or where there is reason to suspect the coins are not genuine. Therefore, to keep matters simple, a player's wealth will be tracked in grams of gold, regardless of the type of currencies the character is actually carrying around. Only if the GM specifically determines a certain currency to not be readily acceptable to merchants should it be registered separately.</p>
<p>Each realm's coin is worth a certain grams of gold, depending on size and the material it is crafted from (generally gold of varying purity, but silver is also common, as are devalued coins with cores made of copper; commoners in developed nations may use copper or bronze coins of meager worth for small transactions; some wealthy merchant cities may mint very valuable platinum coins to ease large transactions). These values are determined by the setting or the campaign document and they remain constant unless specifically noted.</p>
<p>The value of goods fluctuates with varying economic circumstances, but this chapter provides a list of normal prices, that will be used unless a campaign document sets different prices (eg. a shortage of iron leads to doubled prices for swords and iron armor). The lowest price in use is 0.01 gg (gold grams), the value of the lowest denomination copper pieces and of small everyday items: a candle, a loaf of bread, a bowl of soup, etc. A day laborer earns 0.1 gg for eight hours of work, while a skilled craftsman will earn 1 gg, or even more. Treasure hoards and national ledgers may sometimes work with gold in the kilograms; in these rare instances, 1 GK (gold kilograms) = 1000 gg.</p>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any check you make that involves Strength or Dexterity, attacks against your STR/DEX defense have advantage, and you can't cast spells.</p>
<p>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows a Str requirement, then the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 2 squares unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the requirement. If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p>

</table><br/>
<p><b><i>Gambeson.</i></b> Made from several layers of heavy fabric, stuffed with horse hair to provide resilience. The end result is remarkably resilient, as well as light.</p>
<p><b><i>Boiled leather.</i></b> When boiled, animal leather can become really tough, and can be fashioned into a cuirass, with accompanying arm and leg guards. The result is tough and flexible armor, although one that is difficult to repair.</p>
<p><b><i>Hide.</i></b> Employed by wild tribes who lack advanced craftsmanship, hide armor simply involves layers of thick furs sewn together in a primitive armor. It can be quite stifling to wear, but it offers good protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain shirt.</i></b> Made of countless interlocking rings of metal, a chain shirt offers really good protection against anything save a well aimed piercing weapon pushed straight through a gap. It is the standard armor of most respectable warriors, as it is both very protective and reasonably priced.</p>
<p><b><i>Lamellar.</i></b> Several small metal plates are tied together using strong hemp rope. The end result has almost the durability of a breastplate, but it is far easier to manufacture. It is also quite flexible, and as such it is favored by steppe nomads.</p>
<p><b><i>Breastplate.</i></b> Two solid metal pieces, one for the back and one for the front, tied together with leather straps (and usually also tied to a gambeson undergarment). Little can penetrate the breastplate, its only weakness being that it leaves the arms and legs unprotected.</p>
<p><b><i>Half plate.</i></b> This suit of armor combines a breastplate with metal plates protecting the upper legs and forearms, as well as shoulder plates. The downside is that it is difficult to move freely in this suit of armor.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain mail.</i></b> Made of countless interlocking rings of metal that cover the entire body, even the head, for excellent all around protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Reinforced chain.</i></b> Same as the chain mail, except that there is a round metal plate protecting the chest. Furthermore, a solid metal helmet provides even better defenses for the head and neck.</p>
<p><b><i>Plate.</i></b> The best protection money can buy, shy of magical armor. This whole body suit consists of metal plates that cover every possible part of the body, with only minimal weaknesses to be found in the joints.</p>
<br/><h4>Improvised Weapons</h4>
<p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon means any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. If the weapon is reasonably similar to a weapon, then it behaves as that weapon in all respects (for example, a table leg is as good as a club).</p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (or whatever the DM deems appropriate). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 4 squares and a long range of 12 squares.</p>
<h4>Adventuring Equipment</h4>
<p><b><i>Acid Flask.</i></b> 20 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. The target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Alchemist's Fire.</i></b> 25 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Antitoxin.</i></b> 50 gg. Poison attacks against a creature that drinks this vial of liquid are rolled with disadvantage for 1 hour. If the creature is poisoned when drinking the potion, the effect is removed, but the potion has no further effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Block and Tackle.</i></b> 1 gg. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>
<p><b><i>Caltrops.</i></b> 1 gg. As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 1x1 square area. For a creature to traverse the area, it must either move at half speed, or pass a DC 15 Acrobatics check. Failing that, the creature stops moving and takes 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hp, its walking speed is reduced by 2 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Candle.</i></b> 0.01 gg. For one hour, the candle provides bright light for 1 square, and dim light for a further square.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain.</i></b> 5 gg. It's 6m long, can hold 200 kg before bursting can be broken with a DC 20 Force check.</p>
<p><b><i>Climber's anchor and rope.</i></b> 2 gg. This anchor is a long and sturdy steel piton, that can be hammered into a rock cliff, thereby anchoring you to it. As long as you keep the rope tied around your waist, you cannot fall more than 6m below the anchor.</p>
<p><b><i>Crowbar.</i></b> 2 gg. Using a crowbar where its leverage can be applied grants advantage to Strength checks.</p>
<p><b><i>Holy Water.</i></b> 25 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 force damage.</p>
<p>Any cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. For one flask, the ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 24 gg worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>
<p>Unholy Water is the reverse of Holy Water, created by Evil clerics to serve against celestials, fey, and any other Good-aligned planar creatures.</p>
<p><b><i>Hunting Trap.</i></b> 5 gg. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. When a creature steps on the plate, the trap makes a +3 attack vs DEX. On a successful attack, the victim takes 1d4 piercing damage and cannot move anymore. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 1m long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Force check to open the trap and free its captive. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Ink (vial with 30 grams of ink).</i></b> 10 gg. Vital if one wants to write on a parchment with something more elegant (and less painful) than one's own blood. For more crude purposes, a chalk worth 0.01 gg might be more appropriate. A sheet of parchment costs 0.1 gg, while the highly prized paper costs 0.2 gg.</p>
<p><b><i>Lamp.</i></b> 0.5 gg. Casts a bright light in a 3 square radius, and dim light for a further 6 squares. It uses a flask of oil and burns for about 6 hours.</p>

<p><b><i>Manacles.</i></b> 2 gg. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 16 Mechanics check. The chain binding the manacles can be severed using a heavy weapon, or by brute force (DC 22 Force check).</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine Kit.</i></b> 5 gg. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has O hp, with advantage on the Medicine check.</p>
<p><b><i>Oil Flask.</i></b> 0.1 gg. As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within a square of you or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (10 rounds), the target takes an additional 1d10 fire damage from the burning oil and is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 1x1 square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Poison, Basic.</i></b> 50 gg. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action.

<p><b><i>Spellbook.</i></b> 100 gg. A wizard's most essential companion. Losing it means losing all one's spells, as this spellbook is completely blank!</p>
<p><b><i>Thieves' Tools.</i></b> 25 gg. This set of tools inc1udes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. They tools are required in order to disarm traps, pick locks, or tinker with mechanical devices.</p>

<h4 id="equipmentPacks">Equipment Packs</h4>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. These packs may also be bought at specialized shops, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p>
<p><b><i>Burglar's Pack (16 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a bag of ball bearings, two ropes, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 climbing anchors and rope, a lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days of rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><b><i>Diplomat's Pack (39 gg).</i></b> Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, sealing wax, and soap.</p>

<h4>Living Expenses</h4>
<p>When not out in the dungeon or wilderness, you need a place to stay, a hot meal to eat, and perhaps some drink to go along. A comfortable night in a reputable inn, covering good food, drink, and a comfortable bed, costs 1 gg per person. Stingy characters might want to spend less, by going to less reputable establishments, but this exposes them to a real risk of mugging, violence or disease at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>Of course, characters may also choose to reward themselves after a hard day's work, and pay for better lodgings or even lavish parties. This is quite beneficial in striking up relations with the important persons of the day, but it guarantees no gameplay bonus.</p>
