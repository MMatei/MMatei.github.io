<h4>Measuring Distance</h4>
<p>D&amp;D was designed with grid-based combat in mind. Therefore, in all circumstances related to combat (abilities, spells, effects, speed etc), distance will be measured in squares. As a contingency for freeform scenarios, the distance in meters will be displayed within brackets. For reference, a square was originally defined as 5 by 5 feet, which roughly translates to 1.5 by 1.5 meters (error is negligible for the small distances involved in the typical combat).</p>
<h4>Rounding Down</h4>
<p>Whenever you divide a number in the game, always round down.</p>

<br/><h1 id="characterCreation">Creating a Character</h1>
<h4>Step 1: Choose a Race</h4>
<p>See page 18 of the PHB for details on each race (and subraces). Your race determines your base speed, the languages you can speak, as well as a number of racial traits, all of which you should note on your character sheet. Some races may provide adjustments to your ability scores; keep these in mind for step 3.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Choose a Class</h4>
<p>Every adventurer has a certain vocation that determines his/her skills and talents. It is possible to multiclass your adventurer later on, although this is an advanced feature only recommended to experienced players. For the moment, however, you must choose one of the following classes: <a href="classes/barbarian.html">barbarian</a>, <a href="classes/bard.html">bard</a>, <a href="classes/cleric.html">cleric</a>, <a href="classes/druid.html">druid</a>, <a href="classes/fighter.html">fighter</a>, <a href="classes/monk.html">monk</a>, <a href="classes/paladin.html">paladin</a>, <a href="classes/ranger.html">ranger</a>, <a href="classes/rogue.html">rogue</a>, <a href="classes/sorcerer.html">sorcerer</a>, <a href="classes/warlock.html">warlock</a>, <a href="classes/wizard.html">wizard</a>. Your starting class determines your starting hit points, proficiencies and equipment. There might also be some features gained at level 1. Note all of these on your character sheet.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Determine Ability Scores</h4>
<p>Click the button to automatically generate ability scores for your character. You can assign each result to an ability of your choice. You should then add your racial adjustments. Afterwards, compute your ability modifier thusly: (10 - score) / 2, rounded down.</p>
<button onclick="genScores()">Roll!</button>

  <tr><td id="s1"></td><td id="s2"></td><td id="s3"></td><td id="s4"></td><td id="s5"></td><td id="s6"></td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Step 4: Your Character's Personality</h4>
<p>You should pick a personality you can identify with and keep it in mind in all interactions with other characters. If roleplaying isn't your thing, then you should have a character with your personality and play the game as if you are present there in the flesh. Personality isn't just important to increase immersion in the game, it is also tied into the <a href="#inspiration">Inspiration</a> mechanic, which gives your character an edge in situations that tug on a part of their personality. (And ultimately, D&amp;D is a game about characters in an adventure, not just a board game of tactical combat)</p>
<p>Begin by selecting a background for your character (starting at page 128 in the PHB). The background may also provide some additional proficiencies, languages and equipment, which you should note on your character sheet. You should then select two personality traits, an ideal, a bond, and a flaw for your character. You may roll on the tables if you lack inspiration, but you are strongly encouraged to tailor the character to your liking. You can even customize your background if you wish, subject to DM approval.</p>
<p>The DM will take notes on your personality for future reference, especially your flaw, which may be turned against you during the adventure. At this point, you also select the alignment of your character, which serves mostly as a statement of general intent regarding your personality. Depending on the setting, this alignment may or may not be important to the story. Regardless, you are free to act out your character in any way you choose. The DM will adjust your perceived alignment accordingly.</p>
<p>For extra authenticity, you should also keep your ability scores in mind when roleplaying. Low intelligence might mean a lacklustre memory, and perhaps even a reduced ability to reason. Low charisma might mean that perhaps you're shy, or socially awkward, or just have an abrasive personality. Low wisdom might mean obliviousness to detail, recklessness or stubborness. Don't be afraid of playing a flawed character, for it might make the story more interesting in unexpected ways. And seeing a character overcome his/her limitations always makes for a good story.</p>

<br/><h1 id="abilityScores">Ability Scores</h1>
<h4>Advantage and disadvantage</h4>
<p>When someone has advantage on a roll, it rolls two dice and selects the best result. When someone has disadvantage on a roll, it rolls two dice and selects the worst result.</p>
<p>You cannot stack advantages or disadvantages on a roll (you never roll more than two d20s). If a situation brings both an advantage and a disadvantage, they cancel each other out. If you have a trait that allows you to reroll, you can only reroll one of the dice, but you choose which one.</p>
<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
<p>If you are Inspired, you can take an Inspired Action: you can either gain advantage on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw OR you can give advantage to someone else’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw provided you are in a position to assist them directly in some way OR impose disadvantage on someone else’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw provided you are in a position to hinder their action directly in some way. Whatever it is, the Inspired Action MUST somehow connect to one of your Personal Characteristics.</p>
<p>When you aren't Inspired, you can Claim a Setback to become Inspired. To Claim a Setback, you must either impose disadvantage on one of your own ability checks, saving throws, or attack rolls OR make a decision that creates a significant story setback, obstacle, or hindrance, all based on one of your Personal Characteristics.</p>
<p>The GM may Impose Setbacks. That is, in a scene during which one of your Characteristics should work against you, the GM can either impose disadvantage on a related roll or require you to take a detrimental action that somehow creates a story setback. If the player character isn't Inspired, it then becomes Inspired from the Imposed Setback. If the character is Inspired, they may describe how they overcome their Flaw or other trait and they are no longer Inspired.</p>
<p>All player characters begin the adventure Inspired.</p>
<p>Traumatic or life changing events may alter any of the Personal Characteristics. Magical artifacts or effects may also add Compulsions to a PC's Characteristics (acting like an extra flaw).</p>
<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>
<p>Depending on your character's level, you have a certain proficiency bonus (see class progression sheet). This bonus is applied to rolls and saves, if you are proficient in the required skill/attribute.</p>
<h4>Contests</h4>
<p>Sometimes, the efforts of two characters are in direct opposition to each other (such as both trying to snatch the same object). In this case, both contestants make a roll appropriate to the situation, adding relevant modifiers, then compare the results. If there is a tie, then the status quo is maintained (eg. in a contest to pick up a ring on the floor, a tie means that neither character gets it).</p>
<h4>Working Together</h4>
<p>If it is possible and realistic for a character to help another in accomplishing a task, then the helped character makes his roll with advantage. More helping hands will confer no further bonus. The helper must also justify how he is going to be of use, and if skilled work is necessary, then the helper must be proficient in the relevant skill. (For example, if helping someone to disarm a bomb, if you don't have a clue about disarming bombs, then you're useless)</p>
<h4>Group Checks</h4>
<p>Some situations may require the whole group to take a check (like traversing a treacherous swamp). In that case, all characters must roll separately (no aid is permitted). If at least half of the party succeeds, then the whole party succeeds, as we're assuming that those who fail are helped by those who succeeded.</p>
<h4>Skills</h4>
<p>Each attribute (except Constitution) has associated skills. An associated skill receives a bonus from the parent attribute's modifier. It is possible however, at the GM's discretion, to associate a skill with a different attribute, if the situation justifies it. For example, intimidating someone through a show of strength should be an Intimidation (Strength) check, instead of the usual Intimidation (Charisma).</p>
<h4>Strength</h4>
<p>Strength measures both bodily strength and athletic training, the extent to which your strength can also be put to good use. Strength checks are used when pushing or pulling heavy objects, shoving enemies etc.</p>
<p>For melee attacks and thrown weapons, you add your Str modifier to hit chance and damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Carrying capacity.</i></b> You can carry or lift a maximum of 6 * Strength score kg. However, carrying more than half your maximum capacity adds one level of <a href="conditions/exhaustion.html">exhaustion</a> every half an hour.</p>
<p>You can push or drag a weight at most twice your carrying capacity (so 12 * Strength score kg). Whenever this needs to be done in a hurry, a Strength check is required. A baseline DC is objectWeight/10, though this depends a lot on how much friction there is when pushing/dragging the object. For lifting, a decent baseline DC would be objectWeight/4.</p>
<p>For each size over Medium, double a creature's max carrying/pushing/dragging/lifting capacity. For Tiny creatures, halve this amount.</p>
<p><b><i>Athletics.</i></b> Covers climbing, jumping, swimming and other strenuous physical activity that is more about strength than agility.</p>
<h4>Dexterity.</h4>
<p>Dexterity measures the ability to be agile, nimble, or move quietly. It also covers talent in actions that require precision, such as disarming traps, picking locks, or manufacturing and manipulating delicate objects. For ranged weapons (except throwing weapons) and melee weapons with the finesse property, add your Dexterity modifier to hit chance and damage. Some armors allow you to add part of your Dexterity modifier to AC. When unarmored, you add your whole Dexterity modifier to your AC.</p>
<p><b><i>Acrobatics.</i></b> Used for acrobatic stunts (flips, somersaults, rolls etc) and for keeping one's footing on slippery or unsteady terrain (such as a tight rope, or a quaking surface).</p>
<p><b><i>Sleight of hand.</i></b> This covers all sorts of trickeries, subtle movements that you want to go unnoticed, such as pickpocketing, but also the art of trap disarming and lock picking (for these latter two activities, you need thieves' tools, however, or at least a similar set of objects, which can be improvised).</p>
<p><b><i>Stealth.</i></b> Used when you want to hide from somebody.</p>
<p><b><i>Initiative.</i></b> Initiative is a Dexterity roll, but no proficiency bonus applies.</p>
<h4>Constitution</h4>
<p>Measures one's vitality and ability to withstand exertion, as well as toxins, poisons and diseases. No skills are associated with it, but some situations may call for a Constitution check, such as trying to march all day in blistering heat.</p>
<p>For every level you have, you add your Constitution modifier to your max hp. This property is constantly updated, so if you temporarily gain or lose Constitution points, you have to adjust your max hp accordingly.</p>
<h4>Intelligence</h4>
<p>Measures one's memory and ability to reason. However, it does NOT provide a substitute for the player's own intelligence. That is to say, there is no Intelligence roll for the solution to a puzzle; it is the players, not the character, who have to figure that out. The character's intelligence will only deal with things that are impossible for the players to see/know, like history, lore, or subtle clues in the environment.</p>
<p>Intelligence checks are used to appraise an item, win at a game of skill, forge documents, or concoct a suitable disguise. Wizards add their Int modifier to spellcasting DC and chance to hit with a spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcana.</i></b> Deals with knowledge about spells, magic items, rituals, and traditions, as well as the planes of existence and their inhabitants.</p>
<p><b><i>History.</i></b> Your knowledge about the history of the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Investigation.</i></b> Deals with making deductions from the environment, though it stops short of giving full answers. For example, it might reveal that the troll seems to be regenerating after every blow, or that the murder weapon is most likely an axe, but it won't reveal that you need fire or acid to stop the regeneration, or that the murder evidence points to Bob the woodsman. In short, a successful investigation roll will provide some extra hints that aren't exactly apparent to someone who is only imagining the scene; it is, in a way, a step above Perception.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature.</i></b> Your knowledge about the natural world: plants, beasts, terrain and weather cycles.</p>
<p><b><i>Religion.</i></b> Your knowledge about the Deities of the world, their rituals, priesthoods and philosophy. In regards to planes of existence, it overlaps with Arcana somewhat, and both checks are valid for such information.</p>
<h4>Wisdom</h4>
<p>Measures how well you are attuned with the world around you, and also describes a degree of life experience. It is employed when interacting with other beings, as well as a measure of your attention to what is going on. Clerics, druids and rangers add their Wis modifier to spellcasting DC and chance to hit with a spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Animal handling.</i></b> Your capacity to calm down an animal, tame it, or intuit its emotions.</p>
<p><b><i>Insight.</i></b> Determine the intentions and emotions of the creature you are interacting with, for example to determine whether they are lying.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine.</i></b> Ability to care for the wounded. (let's not quibble about the specifics and why this is under Wisdom)</p>
<p><b><i>Perception.</i></b> Used when trying to spot or detect something. Note: all items (worthy of note) that are in plain sight will be described without any checks. A perception check is required only to spot some small detail that might go unnoticed by the casual observer, or to search a wide space for something (specificity increases the chances of success).</p>
<p><b><i>Survival.</i></b> Ability to survive in wilderness, to find food, water and shelter. It is also the ability to track a creature and hunt.</p>
<h4>Charisma</h4>
<p>Measures the ability to influence other and make a positive impact on them. It is very important in social interactions, and can also be used to gather rumors from a crowd. Bards, paladins, sorcerers and warlocks add their Cha modifier to spellcasting DC and chance to hit with a spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Deception.</i></b> Your ability to hide information or outright lie in a social interaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Intimidation.</i></b> Attempting to influence someone through threats, hostile actions and implied violence.</p>
<p><b><i>Performance.</i></b> Ability to act out a role, whether to deceive someone (outright lying is deception, not performance), or to entertain an audience.</p>
<p><b><i>Persuasion.</i></b> Ability to influence someone to view you favorably. Note that to actually persuade someone, you still need convincing arguments (see <a href="#socialInteract">Social Interaction</a>).</p>

<br/><h1 id="adventuring">Adventuring</h1>
<h4>Long Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can jump over 0.25m * Strength score. If you make a standing jump, then you can clear only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. If the landing is expected to be difficult, DC 10 Acrobatics to avoid falling prone.</p>
<h4>Height Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can leap into the air 1m + 0.25m * Strength modifier. If you make a standing jump, then you can leap only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. Since you jump with your hands up, you can reach a ledge as high as jump height + 1.5 * character height.</p>
<h4>Marching Order</h4>
<p>The party must, at all times, have a well established marching order (the formation in which the characters march). When going through tight spaces, the marching order may have to change. The party must establish a default marching order (including who takes point if the situation demands it) and announce changes if and when it is deemed necessary. This is so that the GM doesn't have to ask for a marching order when it's needed, thus potentially tipping off the party than an encounter or trap is imminent.</p>
<h4>Vision and light</h4>
<p><b><i>Lightly obscured.</i></b> An area in dim light, fog, or covered with foliage. Characters trying to see something located in such an area have disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight.</p>
<p><b><i>Heavily obscured.</i></b> An area is not in the line of sight, or is covered in darkness or thick fog. Characters in such an area are effectively <a href="conditions/blinded.html">blind</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Bright light.</i></b> Most creatures can see clearly. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns and fires, within a specific radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Dim light.</i></b> Also called shadow, is a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn, or a particularly brilliant full moon also count as dim light.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkness</i></b> creates a heavily obscured area. The absence of light sources (moonlight doesn't count) creates darkness.</p>
<p><b><i>Blindsight.</i></b> The creature can perceive the environment without sight, in the given radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> The creature treats darkness as if it were dim light, although it can't distinguish colors.</p>
<p><b><i>Truesight.</i></b> A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<h4>Nourishment</h4>
<p>A character needs half a kg of food per day and can go without food for a period equal to 3 + Constitution modifier (a minimum of 1) days. For every subsequent day without food, the character takes one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>A character needs to drink 2 liters of water (or an appropriate substitute) per day, or 4 liters if the weather is hot. If a character drinks only half the required water, DC Con 15 or take a level of exhaustion. If even less water is available, then the character automatically takes a level of exhaustion, two if the characer is already exhausted.</p>
<p>For every size above Medium, a character consumes twice as much food and water. A Tiny character's consumption is halved, on the other hand.</p>
<h4 id="socialInteract">Social Interaction</h4>
<p>It may be the case that the person you're interacting with has objections to helping you out. If that's the case, then the PCs must somehow overcome these objections (convince the person).</p>
<p>The NPC starts with one or more objections, each with a score assigned, defining how strong the objection is. To surpass these objections, the PCs must either address an objection (thus lowering its score) OR provide an incentive to help. The better the argument, the greater the score it has. But to carry this argument across, a PC has to rely on Persuasion or Intimidation (the latter can only be used to provide an incentive of fear – although it is only useful when the person being threatened has something to fear from the PCs). Both sides may employ falsehood or misinformation in the discussion (if you're convinced a false statement is true, it's not lying). In this case, success is determined by a contest of Deception vs Insight.</p>
<p>The NPC is convinced if the score of the incentives equals or surpasses the score of the objections. However, particularly bad arguments or discovered lies can instead increase the strength of objections; a character may choose to end the conversation if the objections become too strong or if the conversation stalls for too long. Also, if the PCs make a particularly offensive remark and it isn't addressed promptly and satisfactorily (if it is even possible), then the conversation also ends.</p>
<p>Some characters may have particular likes or dislikes, which can produce an advantage or disadvantage in the ability checks. For example, a knight might be flattered with praise of his honor and fighting skills, or a racist dwarf might dislike talking to elves.</p>
<p>Some characters may hold to an objection fanatically, thus it's score cannot be lowered by any argument. (For example, a priest is probably fanatically convinced of the philosophy of his Deity) Thus, the only way to convince such a person is to provide matching incentives.</p>
<p>If the conversation is such that small talk is appropriate, then a contest of Insight vs Deception can provide the party with some information on a character's objections.</p>
<h4>Falling</h4>
<p>When a creature falls, it takes 1d6 crushing damage for every 3m of descent, up to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it has avoided damage from falling.</p>
<h4>Short Rest</h4>
<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend available Hit Dice at the end of a short rest. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hp equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.</p>
<h4>Long Rest</h4>
<p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity (reading, talking, eating, or standing watch) for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hp. The character also regains half of its maximum Hit Dice (but can't exceed this maximum). A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hp at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
<h4>Magic Items</h4>
<p>In order to learn what a magic item does, the most reliable way is to cast an <i>Identify</i> spell on it (either yourself, or by hiring the services of a local wizard). The other option is to spend a short rest investigating the item (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). You roll a DC Investigation 10 (certain artifacts might require more). If you fail, you learn nothing, though you can always try again later. If you succeed, then you learn the item's properties, except for those that aren't readily apparent (subtle curses, long-term effects, or the personality quirks of the item, if it's intelligent - though you can glean it's alignment; all these properties only become apparent after you attune to the item).</p>
<p>In order to use a magic item, you must attune to it, which means spending a short rest, concentrating on the item, uninterrupted (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). Once this is done, you can access all of the item's properties (as well as its downsides...).</p>
<p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest.</p>
<p>Your attunement to an item ends when the item has been more than 30m away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest. Some items, however, are cursed and cannot be relinquished without the help of spells, such as <i>remove curse</i>.</p>

<br/><h1 id="combatRules">Combat Rules</h1>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Determine what each side intends to achieve and how it intends to achieve it.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> If one side wants to attack the other by surprise, determine who is surprised.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> If combat is to ensue, roll initiative.</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> Place each combatant on a grid, noting important battlefield features.</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> In descending order of initiative, each character takes its turn, until the conflict is solved.</p>
<h4>Surprise</h4>
<p>A character is considered to be surprised if it fails to spot any of the incoming attackers (each attacker succeeds on a DC Stealth [Passive Perception of character]). A surprised character can't take any action, nor any reaction, on the first turn of combat.</p>
<h4>Initiative</h4>
<p>The initiative of a character is given by a Dexterity roll. A group of identical creatures rolls only once, and acts at the same time. If two characters are tied, roll a d20 for each to determine who has the higher initiative.</p>
<h4>Facing</h4>
<p>Most creatures (exceptions must be explicitly noted) can only see (and therefore fight against) things in a front arc. By default, the front arc consists of all squares in front of, or to the side of, the character. The rest of the squares form the rear arc.</p>
<p>Facing is first determined when initiative is rolled. Afterwards, every time a character willingly moves, he can choose a new facing. A character can also spend his reaction to change his facing following another creature's movement.</p>
<p>A character can only target creatures in its front arc, and attacks made from its rear arc have advantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Flanking.</i></b> If two (or more) allies stand on the sides of a character, they have advantage on attacks against that character.</p>
<h4>A Character's Turn</h4>
<p>During its turn, a character can use these options in any order it wishes: move, action, bonus action. A turn represents a period of 6 seconds.</p>
<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>A character can move during its turn up to its maximum speed. Movement can be interspersed with actions and bonus actions in all possible permutations, so long as the character doesn't exceed its movement speed. If a character can attack twice, for example, it can move, attack, move, attack again, and still move if it has movement speed left.</p>
<p>If a character has several types of movement (eg. land and fly), it can switch between these two types at will. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is O or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>
<p>Movement can be diagonal, however it can't cross the corner of an obstacle that occupies it's entire square. Furthermore, every 3 diagonal moves cost an additional square.</p>
<p><b><i>Difficult terrain.</i></b> If terrain is classified as difficult (rubble, stairs, mud), then movement is twice as expensive (a meter counts as two). A space occupied by a creature always counts as difficult.</p>
<p><b><i>Prone.</i></b> You can drop prone for no cost. Standing up costs half of your movement speed, however. You can't stand up if you don't have enough speed remaining or if your speed is 0. While prone, you can move only through crawling, which costs an extra meter for every meter traversed (so in difficult terrain you spend 3m to move 1m).</p>
<p><b><i>Moving around other creatures.</i></b> It is permitted to move through squares occupied by friendly creatures. You can only move through a space occupied by a hostile creature if you are either larger, or two sizes smaller. You aren't allowed to willingly end your turn in an occupied space.</p>
<p><b><i>Forced into another creature's space.</i></b> If that creature is the same size or smaller, it must make a DC Dex 10. If it fails, the creature is pushed alongside the intruder. If it succeeds, it can choose whether to let the intruder pass through as if the creature isn't there (option changes to sliding into a free square if the intruder's movement ends in the creature's square), or stop the forced movement with a DC Str 10 + #squares intruder still has to traverse. On success, the intruder's movement stops; on failure, both creatures fall prone.</p>
<p>If the creature is larger than the intruder, it can choose to let the intruder move past or stop him (if the intruder would end up in a space occupied by the creature then the intruder is stopped).</p>
<p><b><i>Squeezing.</i></b> A creature can squeeze through a space that's sufficient for a creature one size smaller, but it counts as difficult terrain and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as Dexterity saves. Attacks against this creature have advantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Flying movement.</i></b> If a flying creature is knocked prone, stunned, incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 or it otherwise loses its ability to stay in the air, then the creature falls to the ground, taking falling damage if appropriate. Creatures that hover don't suffer from this problem.</p>
<p><b><i>Creature size.</i></b> Tiny creatures control only a quarter of a square; therefore, up to four of them can occupy the same square at once. Small and medium creatures control a whole square. Large creatures control a 2x2 area, huge creatures 3x3, and gargantuan creatures 4x4 or, in rare cases, even more. At the GM's discretion, combat against a creature 2 sizes larger or more may follow special rules, such as requiring melee characters to climb their foe in order to be able to strike somewhere where it hurts.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>Unless special feats dictate otherwise, a character can only take one of these options during a turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Attack.</i></b> Make an attack with a weapon or natural ability of the character. Certain abilities allow more than one attack in an action.</p>
<p>You must make an attack roll that must equal or exceed the enemy's AC in order to hit them. The attack roll is a d20, to which you add your proficiency bonus (if you're proficient with the weapon you use) and the relevant attribute modifier. If you roll a 20, then the attack is a lucky blow, that hits regardless of the enemy's AC and also does critical damage. If you roll a 1, then the attack automatically misses.</p>
<p>If you hit the enemy, then you roll for damage. See your attack's description for the number and type of dice to use. If the attack hits more than one target, you roll just once for all of them. Your proficiency and attribute modifiers are also added to damage output. In case of critical damage, roll all dice twice.</p>
<p>As an alternative to one of your attacks, you can take one of the following options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grapple.</b> The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and he must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target with an Athletics check contested by the target's Athletics or Acrobatics check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, the target is <a href="conditions/grappled.html">grappled</a>. You can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shove.</b> The enemy must be no more than one size larger than you, and he must be within your reach. You make an Athletics contest against the target's Athletics or Acrobatics (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you can either push the enemy 1 square away or knock him prone. You have advantage if you have the high ground (a slope at least 30&deg;). You have disadvantage if the enemy has the high ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dual wielding.</b> Attack with a light melee or throwing weapon that you're holding in one hand, then use your bonus action to attack with a different light melee or throwing weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Disarm.</b> Use your weapon to knock the enemy's weapon (or an object he might be holding) from his hands. Make a contest of your attack roll (with disadvantage) against the enemy's Athletics or Acrobatics. If you are larger, you gain +2 to the disarm roll (per level of difference); if you are smaller, you're penalized by -2. Recovering the weapon is an action, and it prompts a contest (attack roll against Acrobatics) if an enemy is facing you and willing to contest.</p>
<p><b><i>Cast a spell.</i></b> See the spell description for the time it takes to cast the spell. Some spells use a bonus action, or a reaction, most require one action, while others consume actions over a certain number of rounds.</p>
<p><b><i>Dash.</i></b> Double your movement speed for this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Disengage.</i></b> Your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity on this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Dodge.</i></b> Until your next turn, attacks made against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dex saves. You lose this bonus if you are <a href="conditions/incapacitated.html">incapacitated</a> or your speed drops to 0.</p>
<p><b><i>Help.</i></b> You lend aid to an ally, providing it with advantage on a skill check, provided that your character has the ability to be of use. Alternatively, you can distract a foe (if at all possible), providing one ally with advantage on his first attack roll against that foe. This opportunity is only available until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Hide.</i></b> Make a Stealth roll; all creatures with a Passive Perception lower than your roll can no longer see you. However, if a creature can see you clearly, then you cannot hide from it, irrespective of your Stealth roll. Passive Perception is a score that equals 10 + WIS + Perception skill. Add 5 if creature has advantage on Perception checks. Subtract 5 if creature has disadvantage. You can still be heard and smelled while hiding; if you make a distinctive noise, foes will look in your direction and you are forced to repeat your Stealth roll.</p>
<p><b><i>Improvise.</i></b> You can be creative and have your character do anything that is in his/her power to accomplish within the 6 seconds of a round.</p>
<p><b><i>Ready.</i></b> You prepare to take a reaction contingent on a trigger. You state what the trigger is ('the goblin moves on the trapdoor') and what your action will be ('I pull the trapdoor lever'). If the trigger occurs until the start of your next turn, you use your reaction to enact your statement. Note that if you already used a reaction this round, then you cannot react to the trigger.</p>
<p>If you're readying a spell this way, then your character is keeping it energized, ready to be released when the trigger occurs. This means maintaining <a href="#concentration">concentration</a>. If your concentration is broken, the spell is lost. Only spells that have a casting time of 1 action can be used in this way.</p>
<p><b><i>Use Object.</i></b> Interact with an object, like pulling lever, throwing a rock etc.</p>
<h4>Bonus Actions</h4>
<p>Some abilities or spells require a bonus action. You can only take one bonus action during your turn. Its timing, however, is up to you.</p>
<h4>Other activities</h4>
<p>Simple actions, such as opening a door, unsheathing your sword, signaling your allies, or uttering a short phrase are free and can be done at any time during your turn.</p>
<h4>Reactions</h4>
<p>During your turn, you get one reaction, which is a short response to some trigger. Some abilities are employed during a reaction; the most common example is the attack of opportunity. The Ready action also makes use of the reaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Opportunity attack.</i></b> If you move out of an opponents melee reach, then that opponent can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack on you (following the rules of a regular melee attack). You don't provoke an opportunity attack if you are moved by an external force (such as a shove, or an explosion), because it's too sudden a movement for the average opponent to react to it.</p>
<h4>Ranged attacks</h4>
<p><b><i>Range.</i></b> If a ranged attack has a single distance noted, you can't attack targets beyond this range. If there are two distances, the smaller number is the normal range and the other is the long range, beyond which you can't attack. If you attack targets beyond the normal range, you roll with disadvantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Ranged weapons in melee.</i></b> If you are within a square of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, then your ranged attack rolls have disadvantage.</p>
<h4>Cover</h4>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies. Cover bonuses don't apply to area of effect spells, provided that the cover doesn't stand between the creature and the center of the effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Half cover.</i></b> Provides +2 to AC and Dex saves. A target has half cover if an obstacle covers at least half of its body.</p>
<p><b><i>Three-quarters cover.</i></b> Provides +5 to AC and Dex saves. A target has 3/4 cover if an obstacle covers at least 3/4 of its body. Standing behind a creature your size counts as 3/4 cover.</p>
<p><b><i>Full cover.</i></b> Can't be targeted directly by ranged attacks or spells. A target has full cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>
<h4>Damage resistance and vulnerability</h4>
<p>If a creature has <b>resistance</b> to a damage type, then damage from that source is halved. Conversely, <b>vulnerability</b> doubles damage from that source. This multiplier is applied only after all other damage modifiers have already been added. You can't stack resistance nor vulnerability to a damage type.</p>
<h4>Falling to 0 hp</h4>
<p>Whenever you fall to 0 hp, you immediately fall <a href="conditions/unconscious.html">unconscious</a>. When brought to 0 hp, if there is damage remaining that equals or exceeds your max hp, then you die instantly.</p>
<p>Each turn you start at 0 hp, you must make a death saving throw: if the roll of a d20 is 10 or higher, you gain a success, otherwise you gain a failure. Three failures means you die, while three successes means you stabilize. A stable creature remains unconscious, but is in no danger of dying (unless it takes damage again) and will regain 1hp after 1d4 hours (thus becoming conscious again).</p>
<p>If you roll a 20 on a death saving throw, you gain 1 hp (thus immediately regaining consciousness). If you roll a 1, it counts as two failures.</p>
<p>If you take damage while unconscious, you gain a death save failure. If you take a critical hit, you gain two failures. If the damage equals or exceeds your max hp, you immediately die.</p>
<p>A creature can be stabilized with a DC 10 Medicine.</p>
<h4>Knocking a creature out</h4>
<p>When an attacker reduces an opponent to 0 hp with a melee attack, it can choose to knock out the target, which then falls unconscious and is stable.</p>
<h4>Temporary hit points</h4>
<p>Temporary hp is separate from normal hp. It can't be healed by any means, it doesn't stack (so if you are affected by two boons providing temporary hp, you must choose one of them) and it is always the first to absorb damage. If you have 0 hp, then temporary hp doesn't restore you to consciousness, nor does it stabilize you; it only helps absorb damage while in that state.</p>
<p>Unless the feature that granted you temporary hp has a duration, they last until they are depleted or until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Vulnerable body part</h4>
<p>Foes may have some body part that is both important to combat functions and quite vulnerable. For example, humanoid creatures have arms and legs that, if cut off, impair their combat capacity. The heart, or head, while definitely of supreme importance, are however not vulnerable, as they are always the best defended parts of a body (unless otherwise specified).</p>
<p>A creature can specifically target such a body part, with a disadvantage on the attack roll. The attack deals damage to both the body part and the body itself. If the creature is healed, then it can choose to also apply that healing on a damaged body part. If not otherwise specified, the body part defaults to a quarter of the health of the body. If the body part is reduced to 0hp then it is destroyed, and cannot be healed through ordinary means; furthermore, all abilities granted by that body part are immediately lost.</p>
<p>Vulnerable parts are usually specified in a monster's description, but the GM can accept improvisation on this front if it makes sense. For example, all humanoids rely on their right arm to fight; if destroyed, they may attempt to fight with their left (if at all possible), but at a disadvantage, and only after picking up their weapon. If a leg is destroyed, then movement speed is halved. If both legs are destroyed, then the creature is stuck in prone (this stacks with the halved movement speed).</p>
<h4>Mounted combat</h4>
<p>To mount or dismount, you need to spend half of your movement points (this is impossible to do if your speed is 0).</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will, then you must succeed on a DC Dex 10 or be knocked off the mount, landing prone in a square next to it. If an effect would knock you prone while mounted, the same save applies, or you are knocked off the mount and land prone in a square next to it.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land gracefully in a square next to it. Otherwise, you fall prone in a square next to the mount.</p>
<p>If the mount is intelligent, then it acts independently (although, of course, it can coordinate with its rider if it is so inclined). It has its own spot in the initiative order, and its possibilities are in no way limited by the rider on its back (within the limits of common decency). Conversely, a domesticated and trained mount will act during your turn, with one of these actions: Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.</p>
<p>If a mount provokes an attack of opportunity, then the enemy can attack either you or your mount.</p>
<h4>Underwater combat</h4>
<p>When a creature without swimming speed makes a melee attack with a weapon other than a dagger, short sword, javelin, spear or trident, it suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls.</p>
<p>A ranged attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even within the normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless it's a crossbow, a net, or a javelin (or thrown spear or dart).</p>
<p>Fully submerged creatures have resistance to fire damage.</p>
<h4>Combat against mobs</h4>
<p>Some foes are so outmatched that only sheer numbers can hope to even the scales in their favor. In order to ease bookkeeping in such situations, these foes are handled as a mob.</p>
<p>The mob moves and acts all at once, and it can occupy several squares (loosen the restriction for one Medium creature per square if needed). Damage is applied to the mob as a whole, and several individuals can be killed with one attack. When attacking, determine the d20 roll an individual creature would need to hit. If it's 1-5, apply damage for every individual in the mob; if 6-12, for every 2; if 13-14, for every 3; if 15-16, for every 4; if 17-18, for every 5; if 19, for every 10; if 20, for every 20.</p>
<h4>Instant kills</h4>
<p>If an enemy is unable to defend himself and you are armed with a lethal melee weapon, then you can kill him instantly, without any checks. A sleeping target can be killed instantly with just a Stealth check, rolled with advantage, against the target's Passive Perception. Targets who are completely at ease (unaware there is a foe around) can also be instantly killed with a Stealth check against the target's Passive Perception (this is separate from the check to Hide; and in this case you receive no advantages from being obscured or invisible).</p>

<br/><h1 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h1>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell.</p>
<p>The effects of the same spell don't overlap if the spell is cast multiple times on the same target. Different spells can overlap, however.</p>
<h4>Spell slots</h4>
<p>Excepting a select few characters that posses the ability of innate spellcasting, everyone needs to spend a spell slot of an equal or higher level to the spell one desires to cast. Cantrips, or 0 level spells, are an exception to this rule, as they are so easy, and so well practiced by the magic user, that they can be employed at will.</p>
<p>A spell always assumes the level of the slot used to cast it. A spell may thus assume a higher level and become more powerful (consult the spell's description for specifics).</p>
<p>Some spells can be cast as a ritual, provided that they have the ritual tag in their description. In this form, the spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast, but it doesn't consume a spell slot (this, however, means that a ritual spell's level can't be increased). The magic user needs a special trait in order to cast rituals and, unless specified otherwise, the caster needs to have the spell prepared (check class description for specifics on spell preparing).</p>
<h4>Components</h4>
<p>Each spell's description specifies what components are needed in order to cast the spell. If you can't provide one of the components, then you are unable to cast the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Verbal (V).</i></b> Words of power or chants. A gagged or silenced character can't provide this component.</p>
<p><b><i>Somatic (S).</i></b> At least one free hand is required in order to perform the intricate gestures demanded by the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Material (M).</i></b> If the materials required are common, then a component pouch or a spellcasting focus are sufficient to meet this requirement. However, some spells require rare (and expensive) materials, which must be explicitly bought and used. Every casting of the spell consumes its required materials. A spellcaster needs a free hand to use the materials, though it can be the same hand employed in the somatic component.</p>
<h4 id="concentration">Concentration</h4>
<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
<p>The following situations are detrimental to a spellcaster's concentration: casting another spell that requires concentration, being incapacitated or killed, or taking damage (DC Con [max(10, damage/2)]). At the GM's discretion, certain stressful situations may impose a DC Con 10 to maintain concentration.</p>
<h4>Area of effect</h4>
<p>Spells with an area of effect have a point of origin and a shape along which the effect manifests itself. If there's an obstacle that provides full cover between a creature and the point of origin, that creature is safe from the effects of the spell.</p>
<p><b><i>Cone.</i></b> A cone's width at any point is equal to the distance to its point of origin, which isn't included in the area of effect, unless you decide so. When playing on squares, at even distances from the point of origin, n-1 squares are affected. (Half a square on each side is also nominally affected, but we'll be sensible and consider that the creatures have plenty of room to dodge)</p>
<p><b><i>Cube.</i></b> The point of origin lies on the side of the cube and isn't included in the area of effect unless you decide so.</p>
<p><b><i>Cylinder.</i></b> The point of origin lies at the base of the cylinder and is included in the area of effect. The cylinder has a radius, as well as length. Over half of a square must lie within the area of effect for it the effect to apply there.</p>
<p><b><i>Sphere.</i></b> The sphere extends outwards from its point of origin. Over half of a square must lie within the area of effect for it the effect to apply there.</p>
<h4>Schools of Magic</h4>
<p>Somewhat arbitrarily, wizards have divided magic into 8 different schools, based on their effects. No distinction is made based on the source of the magic that power the spell, which fuels considerable controversy over this classification. Nevertheless, this is the widely accepted theory.</p>
<p><b><i>Abjuration</i></b> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>Conjuration</i></b> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another, as well as the creation of matter from the Weave. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location.</p>
<p><b><i>Divination</i></b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p>
<p><b><i>Enchantment</i></b> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</p>
<p><b><i>Evocation</i></b> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p>
<p>Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that aren't there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Necromancy</i></b> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Its effects may seem unnatural to most people, so check setting details for information on how necromancy is perceived throughout society.</p>
<p><b><i>Transmutation</i></b> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature. bolsler the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abililies to rapidly recover from injury.</p>

<br/><h1 id="equipment">Equipment</h1>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p>
<p>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows a Str requirement, then the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 2 squares unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the requirement.</p>
<p>If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p>
<h4>Improvised Weapons</h4>
<p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon means any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. If the weapon is reasonably similar to a weapon, then it behaves as that weapon in all respects (for example, a table leg is as good as a club).</p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (or whatever the DM deems appropriate). If a characler uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 4 squares and a long range of 12 squares.</p>
<h4>Adventuring Equipment</h4>
<p><b><i>Acid Flask.</i></b> 25gp. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. The target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Alchemist's Fire.</i></b> 25gp. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Antitoxin.</i></b> 50gp. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.</p>
<p><b><i>Ball Bearings.</i></b> 1gp. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level area 2x2 squares. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dex or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.</p>
<p><b><i>Block and Tackle.</i></b> 1gp. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>
<p><b><i>Caltrops.</i></b> 1 gp. As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 1x1 square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on DC 15 Dex or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hp, its walking speed is reduced by 2 squares. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.</p>
<p><b><i>Candle.</i></b> 1cp. For one hour, the candle provides bright light for 1 square, and dim light for a further square.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain.</i></b> 5gp. It's 6m long, has 10hp and can be burst with a DC 20 Str check.</p>
<p><b><i>Climber's anchor and rope.</i></b> 2gp. This anchor is a long and sturdy steel piton, that can be hammered into a rock cliff, thereby anchoring you to it. As long as you keep the rope tied around your waist, you cannot fall more than 6m below the anchor.</p>
<p><b><i>Crowbar.</i></b> 2gp. Using a crowbar where its leverage can be applied grants advantage to Strength checks.</p>
<p><b><i>Holy Water.</i></b> 25gp. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p>
<p>Any cleric or paladin serving a Good Deity may create holy water by performing a special ritual. For one flask, the ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 24 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>
<p>Unholy Water is the reverse of Holy Water, created by Evil clerics to serve against celestials, fey, and any other Good-aligned planar creatures.</p>
<p><b><i>Hunting Trap.</i></b> 5gp. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on apressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree ar a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on DC 13 Dex or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 1m long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Str to open the trap and free its captive. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Ink (vial with 30g of ink).</i></b> 10gp. Vital if one wants to write on a parchment with something more elegant (and less painful) than one's own blood. For more crude purposes, a chalk worth 1cp might be more appropriate. A sheet of parchment costs 1sp, while the highly prized paper costs 2sp.</p>
<p><b><i>Lamp.</i></b> 5sp. Casts a bright light in a 3 square radius, and dim light for a further 6 squares. It uses a flask of oil and burns for about 6 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Lantern.</i></b> 15gp. Has a bullseye that directs light in a bright cone facing forwards. It casts a bright light for 12 squares, and dim light for an additional 12 squares. It also has a hood that can be lowered, so that the lantern only gives off dim light in 1 square. It uses a flask of oil and burns for about 6 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Manacles.</i></b> 2gp. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dex check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Str check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Sleight of Hand check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine Kit.</i></b> 5gp. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has O hp, with advantage on the Medicine check.</p>
<p><b><i>Oil Flask.</i></b> 1sp. As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within a square of you ar throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature ar object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (10 rounds), the target takes an additional 1d10 fire damage from the burning oil and is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 1x1 square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Poison, Basic.</i></b> 100gp. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Con or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 10 rounds before drying.</p>
<p><b><i>Potion of Healing.</i></b> 50gp. A character who drinks the magical red fiuid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p>
<p><b><i>Quiver.</i></b> 1gp, 20 arrows or 20 crossbow bolts or 40 blowgun needles or 500 stone sling bullets, or 100 lead sling bullets (+1).</p>
<p><b><i>Rope.</i></b> 5sp. It's 6m long, has 2hp and can be burst with a DC 17 Str check.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellbook.</i></b> 50gp. A wizard's most essential companion. Losing it means losing all one's spells, as this spellbook is completely blank!</p>
<p><b><i>Thieves' Tools.</i></b> 25gp. This set of tools inc1udes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks. They are, at any rate, required in order to attempt these actions at all (you can also improvise these tools, if there are adequate materials at hand).</p>
<p><b><i>Torch.</i></b> 1cp. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 4 square radius and dim light for an additional 4 squares. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1d4 crushing + 1 extra fire damage.</p>
<h4 id="equipmentPacks">Equipment Packs</h4>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. These packs may also be bought at specialized shops, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p>

<h4>Living Expenses</h4>
<p>When not out in the dungeon or wilderness, you need a place to stay, a hot meal to eat, and perhaps some drink to go along. A modest lifestyle, covering the basic comforts a person of the middle class might expect, costs 1gp per person. Stingy characters might want to spend less, by going to less reputable establishments, but this exposes them to a real risk of mugging, violence or disease (roll a 1d10; on a roll less or equal to the number of sp saved, something bad happens, at the DM's discretion).</p>
<p>Of course, characters may also choose to reward themselves after a hard day's work, and pay for better lodgings or even lavish parties. This is quite beneficial in striking up relations with the important persons of the day, though it offers no concrete bonus.</p>
