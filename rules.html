<br/><h1 id="core">Core Concepts</h1>
<h4>Game Master (GM)</h4>
<p>The Game Master (or GM, for short) is the storyteller and arbiter in a game of AD&amp;D. The GM narrates the world, plays the non-player characters (NPCs), and altogether provides the framework in which the game takes places. Consequently, he/she is also enforcing the rules of the game world and also adjuticating them where they are unclear/incomplete. In essence, a GM acts as the spirit of the universe the game takes place in, enforcing the natural laws and moving events forward.</p>
<p>It is the GM's duty to be responsible, fair, and consistent in the use of his/her powers. It is strongly encouraged that GM rulings be conservative, that is to say as close as possible to the spirit of the rules contained herein. For example, the GM should prefer only slightly altering a rule for a new situation, rather than inventing a new rule or subsystem entirely. This is because a game's balance is a fragile and delicate thing, liable to be broken by apparently slight perturbations.</p>
<h4>Measuring Distance</h4>
<p>AD&amp;D was designed with grid-based combat in mind. Therefore, whenever distance is of concern, it is measured in squares. As a contingency for freeform scenarios, the distance in meters will be displayed within brackets. For reference, a square was originally defined as 5 by 5 feet, which roughly translates to 1.5 by 1.5 meters (error is negligible for the small distances involved in the typical combat).</p>
<h4>Division and Rounding</h4>
<p>Whenever you divide a number in the game, always round down, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h4>Advantage and disadvantage</h4>
<p>When someone has advantage on a roll, one rolls two dice and selects the best result. When someone has disadvantage on a roll, one rolls two dice and selects the worst result.</p>
<p>You cannot stack advantages or disadvantages on a roll (you never roll more than two d20s). If a situation brings both an advantage and a disadvantage, they cancel each other out. If you have a trait that allows you to reroll, you can only reroll one of the dice, but you choose which one.</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>Your character's raw physical and mental capacities are defined by six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These are numbers ranging from a minimum of -5 (meaning complete and utter lack of said ability), to 0 (the ability of the average untrained human), to +5 (the peak of ability for most mortal heroes). Some rare, very powerful beings (including player characters over level 20) can go beyond +5.</p>
<p>One thing all attributes have in common is that you add them to any roll (weapon attack, ability, spell, skill, etc) that uses that attribute. For example, you add Strength to a hit roll when attempting to strike with a greatsword, but also when you try to grapple.</p>
<p><b>Strength</b> measures the raw force in your body and the ability to put it to good use. Strength is required when pushing or pulling heavy objects, shoving enemies, breaking down stuff, etc. But perhaps more importantly, Strength is vital for effectively wielding most weapons, and for inflicting damage. Whether it is for an axe chop, pulling a bow string, or handling the fickle and powerful currents of magic, Strength increases dealt damage (by the value of the score, unless otherwise specified).</p>
<p id="encumbrance"> You can comfortably carry a maximum of 25 + 5 * Strength kg. If needed, you can carry up to 50% more, but you suffer one level of <a href="conditions/exhaustion.html">exhaustion</a> every hour. Tiny creatures can carry only half this amount. For every size over Medium, the carrying capacity is doubled.</p>
<p><b>Dexterity</b> measures the ability to be agile, nimble, or move quietly. It also covers talent in actions that require precision, such as disarming traps, picking locks, or manufacturing and manipulating delicate objects. Dexterity also adds to your initiative rolls and contributes to one's Deflection defense depending on the armor worn. For weapons and abilities with the Dexterity tag, you add this score to hit roll, provided that you are proficient with the weapon you use.</p>
<p><b>Constitution</b> measures one's vitality and ability to withstand exertion, as well as toxins, poisons, alcohool, and diseases. There are trying situations aplenty that may call for a simple Constitution check, such as trying to outdrink someone, trying to hold the contents of your stomach in the presence of a pungent smell, or trying to endure punishment without making a sound. Your Constitution score is added to your maximum Health.</p>
<p>For every level you have, you add your Constitution to your maximum Stamina. If you temporarily gain or lose Constitution, then you also have to adjust your maximum Stamina accordingly. Any addition to maximum Stamina is also made to current Stamina, but lowering the maximum Stamina will not modify current Stamina so long as it is not greater than the new maximum Stamina.</p>
<p><b>Intelligence</b> represents the character's capacity to store knowledge, as well as the skill to put that knowledge to good use. A character with good intelligence won't just recite a book on elven history - he will point out the specific passage that is relevant to the problem at hand. However, the actual task of reasoning on the available information is left to the player. Intelligence is useful when appraising an item, disputing a game of skill, forging documents, or preparing a suitable disguise.  More importantly, intelligence determines how many proficiencies a character can have. For Wizards, Spellblades and Arcane Tricksters, it determines their ability to memorise the intricate arcane magic, thus determining their spellpower.</p>
<p><b>Wisdom</b> represents a combination of life experience, perception and attunement to the environment. It is a measure of your attention to what is going on and can be actively employed to discern or interpret the unusual. For Clerics, Druids, Rangers, and Monks, it also represents the strength of their connection to their source of power and thus determines their spellpower.</p>
<p><b>Charisma</b> measures one's strength of will and character, and confidence in oneself. It is very important in social interactions, when one wants to be noticed or to get a point across. NPCs will have a better starting impression of charismatic characters. For Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers and Warlocks, it represents their resolve and control over their inner magic and thus determines their spellpower.</p>
<h3>Hit Points & Health</h3>
<p>Hit Points (hp) represent a character's energy in defending him/herself from serious harm. All damage suffered by the character is subtracted from the hp, while they are above 0. This represents the character deflecting, parrying, or taking only a minor bruise or cut. If damage would reduce hp below 0, it is set to 0 and the character takes 1 Health damage and an injury. Unless otherwise specified, and injury's effects last until it receives adequate attention (either a Medicine Roll followed by uninterrupted long rest or strong enough magic). While hp remains 0, the character is <a href="conditions/bloodied.html">bloodied</a>, and should take cover and seek to recover hp, as he/she is now very vulnerable to further damage.</p>
<p>Health is a measure of a character's physical integrity, and if it drops to 0, then that character dies, unless it is a Hero, or a Player Character, in which case it falls <a href="conditions/unconscious.html">unconscious</a> and is maimed instead. Maiming means rolling on the maim table, which can still result in death, or a debilitating effect that can only be healed by very powerful magic. Every time your character takes Health damage, you must roll on the injury table to determine what happens. Health is determined by a character's class, and is boosted by Constitution. Unlike other stats, Health doesn't increase as a character levels up, with very few opportunities to increase it.</p>

  <tr><th>d20</th><th>Injury</th><th>Effect</th></tr>

<h3>Action Resolution - The Core Mechanic</h3>
<p>All uncertain situations in the game revolve around this core mechanic (with some modifications). Whenever something isn't explicitly presented in the rules, the GM should default to the core mechanic.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A character declares an action and the desired outcome of that action (unless the outcome is obvious).</li>
  <li>GM decides: is the outcome achievable by that course of action? Is the character capable of performing that action?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>YES &#10132; Go to step 3.</li>
    <li>NO &nbsp;&#10132; Go back to step 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>GM decides: does the action have any chance of failing?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>YES &#10132; Go to step 4.</li>
    <li>NO &nbsp;&#10132; The action succeeds exactly as intended. Go to step 6</li>
  </ul>
  <li>GM determines what attribute governs the action and what proficiency might be involved (if several possibilities, ask player for details on exactly what the character intends to do). The GM also determines an appropriate modifier for the roll - negative numbers make the action more difficult. Provide the player with all this information, then ask if he/she wants to proceed or reconsider.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>YES &#10132; Go to step 5.</li>
    <li>NO &nbsp;&#10132; Go back to step 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Does the action succeed? Roll a d20, add the character's relevant bonuses (governing attribute, relevant proficiency, status effects, etc), then subtract the modifier. The answer is:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><xx style="padding-right:1.5ch">20+</xx>&#10132; YES, AND... (<i>critical success</i> &mdash; the action succeeds spectacularly, with an additional boon [if at all possible]; eg. the action takes less to complete than expected)</li>
    <li><xx style="padding-right:1.5ch">15&minus;19</xx>&#10132; YES (<i>success</i> &mdash; the action succeeds exactly as intended)</li>
    <li><xx style="padding-right:0.5ch">10&minus;14</xx>&#10132; YES, BUT... (<i>partial success</i> &mdash; player chooses: action succeeds only partially [if this is possible], action succeeds, but there is a complication [explained beforehand by the GM], action fails with minimal possible consequences [time is still wasted, for example])</li>
    <li><xx style="padding-right:1.5ch">2&minus;9</xx>&#10132; NO (<i>failure</i> &mdash; the action fails, causing all the consequences of failure to happen)</li>
    <li><xx style="padding-right:2.5ch">&lt;1</xx>&#10132; NO, AND... (<i>critical failure</i> &mdash; the character fumbles and not only suffers the consequences of failure, but also an additional complication, determined by the GM)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The GM narrates the outcome of the action.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever an action resolution is required by a game mechanic, the text will ask for a 'Roll &lt;attribute&gt; (&lt;skill&gt;) vs &lt;modifier&gt;'. This provides all the information the GM needs for action resolution (although sometimes there might be a choice of skills).</p>
<h4>Reacting to Danger</h4>
<p>Whenever a character is in immediate danger, but has a split second to react, the GM can invoke this rule. The GM describes what the character is aware of. The player then describes their reaction. The GM then determines if the reaction could avoid or mitigate the unexpected event, whether it can succeed, and whether it can fail. The GM can then ask for an Ability Check based on the action, or may impose advantage/disadvantage on the effect. Any spell that can be cast as a Reaction can be used in this instance.</p>
<h4>Working Together</h4>
<p>When two or more characters work together to accomplish the same task, the character with the higher modifier leads the effort. The leader makes the appropriate ability check and enjoys a +2 bonus for one or two helpers or a +5 bonus for three or more helpers. Characters can only work together if the task is such that help is feasible and possible. In addition, a character can only help with a task if they are capable of attempting the task on their own (for example, in cases where Proficiency is required).</p>
<h4>Group Checks</h4>
<p>When several PCs are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM can call for a group check. First, the GM determines whether the group will succeed if any member succeeds (such as with searching) or if the group will fail if any member fails (such as with stealth).</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the group rolls a single check using the highest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have advantage on the check, the check is made with advantage. If any member of the group is benefiting from any bonuses that would apply to the check, the best single one of those bonuses is also applied to the check.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, the group rolls a single check using the lowest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have disadvantage on the check, the check is made with disadvantage. If any member of the group is suffering from any penalties that would affect the check, the single worst one of those penalties is also applied to the check.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Skills describe the character's knowledge and proficiency in a certain practical domain. Skills can be either trained or untrained. A character can only use a skill in which he/she is trained - in that case, the character adds its proficiency bonus to the roll for which the skill applies.</p>
<p><b><i>Acrobatics.</i></b> Used for acrobatic stunts (flips, somersaults, rolls etc) and for keeping one's footing on slippery or unsteady terrain (such as a tight rope, or a quaking surface).</p>
<p><b><i>Escape artist.</i></b> Used to escape from all sorts of restraints, including an enemy's grapple, but also to restrain someone.</p>
<p><b><i>Mechanics.</i></b> Covers both knowledge of mechanical devices (such as locks or traps) and the ability to tinker with them in a safe way. Used to safely investigate a trap, disarm it, or unlock a door. Usually involves the use of thieves' tools.</p>
<p><b><i>Sleight of hand.</i></b> This covers all sorts of trickeries and subtle movements that you want to go unnoticed, such as pickpocketing, or drawing a knife without being noticed.</p>
<p><b><i>Stealth.</i></b> Used when you want to hide from somebody.</p>
<p><b><i>Athletics.</i></b> Covers climbing, jumping, swimming and other strenuous physical activity that is more a question of sustaining effort, rather than pure application of brute strength.</p>
<p><b><i>Arcana.</i></b> Deals with knowledge about anything magical in nature: spells, rituals, other planes of existence and their inhabitants.</p>
<p><b><i>Crafting.</i></b> Your knowledge about and skill in the crafting of a certain category of objects. When you choose to become proficient in this skill, you must also choose one of the following categories: smithing, woodworking, weaving, masonry, alchemy, arcana, jewelry, brewing etc. Each category is treated as a separate skill.</p>
<p><b><i>Forgery.</i></b> Your skill in imitating the writing or drawing style of others, so as to be able to produce documents (or other objects) that can be attributed to someone else.</p>
<p><b><i>History.</i></b> Your knowledge about the history of the world (anything that can be found in a historic text or in bardic poems). It has some overlap with Arcana and Religion, but only in regards to historical facts.</p>
<p><b><i>Linguistics.</i></b> Your ability to pick up new (or slightly different) languages. With enough study or checks for the same language, you might even become fluent in it.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine.</i></b> Ability to care for the sick and stabilize unconscious characters, as well as knowledge of herbalism. Can use a herbalist's kit to prepare herbal remedies.</p>
<p><b><i>Nature.</i></b> Your knowledge about the natural world: plants, beasts, terrain and weather cycles.</p>
<p><b><i>Religion.</i></b> Your knowledge about the Deities of the world, their rituals, priesthoods and philosophy. Since some religious artifacts are magical in nature, it might overlap with Arcana, and both checks would be valid for such information.</p>
<p><b><i>Animal handling.</i></b> Your capacity to calm down an animal, tame it, or understand its behavior.</p>
<p><b><i>Insight.</i></b> Determine the intentions and emotions of the creature you are interacting with, for example to determine whether they are lying.</p>
<p><b><i>Perception.</i></b> Used when trying to spot or detect something. Note that all important features that are in plain sight will be automatically noticed by the character, while hidden features can be automatically discovered by a character with high enough Passive Perception. A perception check is required only when actively searching for something (with the DC determined by how specific the search is).</p>
<p><b><i>Survival.</i></b> Ability to survive in wilderness, to find food, water and shelter. It is also the ability to track a creature and hunt.</p>
<p><b><i>Deception.</i></b> The ability to hide information or outright lie in a social interaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Friendliness.</i></b> The ability to socialize with unknown people, get them to like you and to talk freely to you. Used chiefly in order to gather information in unknown locales, but also to help warm up a character for a more productive interaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Intimidation.</i></b> Attempting to influence someone through threats, hostile actions and implied violence.</p>
<p><b><i>Performance.</i></b> Ability to act out a role, whether to deceive someone (outright lying is deception, not performance), or to entertain an audience.</p>
<p><b><i>Persuasion.</i></b> Ability to influence someone to view you favorably. Note that to actually persuade someone, you still need convincing arguments (see <a href="#socialInteract">Social Interaction</a>).</p>
<h3>Other stats</h3>
<h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>
<p>The Proficiency Bonus is a number determined by a character's highest level class (see class progression table). This bonus is added to every skill or attribute defense the character is proficient in (proficiencies are explicitly determined by a character's class and choices during character creation).</p>
<h4 id="defenses">Defenses</h4>
<p>Every attack (whether physical or magical) is opposed by one of seven defenses: Deflection, Firmness, Reflex, Endurance, Warding, Intuition, or Will. The last six are solely determined by each of the six attribute scores, and their value equals attribute + Proficiency Bonus (if character is proficient in that defense type).</p>
<p>Deflection defends against direct physical attacks and is determined by a character's armor (or armor-like spell) and dexterity. The base (unarmored) value is equal to Dexterity, but wearing armor changes this value. Some armors may restrict the size of the Dexterity bonus that can be added to Deflection (but negative values will still be subtracted). Heavy armor (and other effects that do not mention Dexterity) ignore Dexterity altogether.</p>
<p>Firmness opposes attempts to overpower the character. Reflex opposes threats which only quick action can mitigate, such as explosions and sudden perils. Endurance opposes toxins, disease or other strains on the body. Warding opposes hostile magic that doesn't target the senses or the mind. Warding is influenced by Intelligence since it helps to know counter-charms or small tricks to avoid magical effects. Intuition opposes magical illusions and other attacks on one's senses. Will opposes attacks that seek to intimidate, terrorise, or twist the mind and subvert one's thoughts.</p>
<h4>Passive Proficiencies</h4>
<p>All skills are assumed to represent both active uses of those things and relevant background knowledge, lore, information, and awareness, as well as passive defenses to situations that might test that skill. A character’s Passive Proficiency for a skill equals attribute (the one most often associated with that skill) + Proficiency Bonus (if the character is proficient in that skill). If the character has Advantage on a skill, the corresponding Passive Proficiency gains an additional +5. If the character has Disadvantage, the character gets a -5 penalty. Any bonus that can be granted to a skill roll, such as from Bardic Inspiration or from a Cleric’s bless spell will also be applied to Passive Proficiencies.</p>
<p><i>Example 1: Alice encounters a strange mural depicting an unknown figure. If she has proficiency in Religion and Passive Religion is greater or equal to a threshold set in the adventure description, then the GM informs her that she recognizes the mural as a depiction of the long-forgotten Goddess Asura. Alice can, of course, make an active Religion roll to actively investigate the mural. Sometimes, this may yield additional information that a cursory glance would not.</i></p>
<p><i>Example 2: A thief tries to sneak past Alice. To succeed, the thief must Roll Dexterity (Stealth) vs Alice's Passive Perception.</i></p>
<h4>Tasks that require tools</h4>
<p>There are some tasks that can only be performed if one has the adequate tools. For example, picking a lock requires thieves' tools. The GM may allow improvised tools to work (provided that said tools can be improvised with the resources at hand), but the check will be performed with disadvantage. Note that adequate tools can actually be crafted by a professional - for example, a skilled smith can probably craft a set of thieves' tools (even with an improvised forge), which will then behave as a set bought from a merchant. Improvisation refers specifically to employing objects that were not meant for the task at hand.</p>
<h4>Language proficiencies</h4>
<p><b><i>Common.</i></b> As the name implies, this is the most widely spoken language in the world. Some sages say that this is the ancestral tongue of humans, but it is far more likely to be an amalgamation of many different tongues of races common and exotic, slowly evolving for the milennia since the birth of the written word. Whatever its origin, it has been kept alive by every empire worth its name and by long-distance traders. In times of collapse, regions might develop dialects of Common, but rarely does this isolation last so long as to render their speech unintelligible. Thus, nearly every sentient speaks some dialect of Common.</p>
<p><b><i>Elvish.</i></b> Just like the race that speaks it, elvish is a sophisticated language (some might say too complicated), with many different words for even the slightest variation in meaning. The words themselves are long, and thus the language is time-consuming and difficult to master, especially as elves are very precious about pronounciation. Their language is rich in vowels (and thus quite melodic), but lacking in consonants, which can create some difficulty to outsiders since so many words seem to sound very similar. Elvish script is similarly complex and beautiful. It is a cursive alphabet where letters are written slightly different depending on the letters next to them, so that the end result looks like a piece of art, not just simple writing. In fact, elves consider it a major offence to write in a rush and thus botch the job. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
<p><b><i>Dwarvish.</i></b> Dwarvish is generally a complicated language, one that has changed quite little over the ages. However, what changes do appear in the spoken form have never been adapted to the written, and so reading and writing Dwarvish is the most difficult part of mastering the language. Dwarvish words are generally short, especially those relating to military or mining terms. There is a large vocabulary to master, but one rarely misunderstands what a dwarf says.</p>
<p>Dwarven script is frugal and angular, designed to be easy to carve into stone. There are many more consonants than in any other language, and they are liberally employed, making dwarf speech sound grating to foreigner ears.</p>
<p><b><i>Giant.</i></b> A peculiar language that few outsiders get the opportunity to learn, the tongue of giants relies much on volume to convey meaning. The script is inspired by Dwarfish, as giants are also fond of monumental inscriptions. The giant script, however, also has markers for the volume used in speaking, so that meaning is not lost in writing.</p>
<p><b><i>Draconic.</i></b> Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest extant languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants, clicks, and sibilants, that are very difficult for most other creatures to pronounce properly.</p>
<p><b><i>Gnomish.</i></b> Gnomish is a soft dialect of Dwarvish, constructed out of the inability of Gnomes to pronounce harsh consonants (eg. the Dwarvish for city - khaz - is pronounced cas). Their writing style is also a bastardized version of Dwarvish, with harsh angles softened into curves. This is indeed much hard to carve into stone, but Gnomes prefer to paint, anyway.</p>
<p><b><i>Goblin.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Orcish.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Abyssal.</i></b> The tongue of demons, it is as chaotic and ever-changing as they are, such that there is no mortal that can truly master it.</p>
<p><b><i>Infernal.</i></b> The tongue of devils; it is said one must sacrifice a sliver of one's soul in order to master it.</p>
<p><b><i>Celestial.</i></b> The tongue of angels and other servants of the gods of good.</p>
<p><b><i>Auran.</i></b> Auran is a language of whistles that has no official written form. It is spoken by Aarakocra, Kenku, and other related species.</p>
<p><b><i>Deep Speech.</i></b> The tongue of the horrific mind flayers and their servants. It has no written form since mind flayers regard writing as a tool of savages. At any rate, deep speech isn't made to be spoken out loud, but rather to exchange in thought form. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to comprehend by other races.</p>
<p><b><i>Primordial.</i></b> This is the language of the sentient Elementals.</p>
<p><b><i>Sylvan.</i></b> Spoken by sentient woodland creatures, Sylvan has no written form since these creatures see no point in writing. Sylvan is a language that only the very patient can speak properly, as it relies on very long sounds that are dragged as if spoken in slow motion.</p>
<h4 id="feats">Feats</h4>
<p>Feats are very particular abilities that do not readily fit the training of any one class. These may be inborn abilities, or specialist skills picked up during one's adventures. When a character gains an Attribute Improvement, he/she can forego it in exchange for a feat from the following list.</p>
<p><b><i>Alert.</i></b> Always ready to spring into action, you gain a +5 bonus to initiative.</p>
<p><b><i>Athlete.</i></b> When you are prone, standing up uses only 1 square of your movement. Climbing doesn't halve your speed. The bonus to your jump distance from Strength is doubled.</p>
<p><b><i>Actor.</i></b>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures and incorporate this into your deception attempts, but must make an additional Deception roll vs Passive Insight. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute.</p>
<p><b><i>Charger.</i></b> When you use your action to Dash, you can use a quick action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 2 squares in a straight line immediately before taking this quick action, you either gain a +6 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or you gain +3 on the shove roll and can push the target up to 2 squares away from you on success.</p>
<p><b><i>Combat Heal.</i></b> When you take the Dodge action, you can also spend one Hit Die to heal: roll the die, add your Constitution modifier and regain that many hit points.</p>
<p><b><i>Dual Wielder.</i></b> You now attack with both weapons as part of a single Attack action.</p>
<p><b><i>Fast Healer.</i></b> When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution.</p>
<p><b><i>Healer.</i></b> When you use a healer's kit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point. As an action. you can spend one use of a healer's kit to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature's number of Hit Dice. The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Heavy Armor Master.</i></b> While wearing heavy armor, you take 3 less damage when hit with crushing, slashing or piercing damage. You will always suffer a minimum of 1 damage, however.</p>
<p><b><i>Inspiring Leader.</i></b> You can spend 10 minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you and who can understand you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to your level + Charisma.</p>
A creature can't gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest.</p>
<p><b><i>Mage Slayer.</i></b> You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits: When a creature within 1 square of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. When you damage a creature that is concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the roll it makes to maintain its concentration. Attack rolls from spells cast within 1 square of you are made with disadvantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Mobile.</i></b> Your speed increases by 1 square. When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn. When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</p>
<p><b><i>Keen Eyes.</i></b> If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips. Gain +5 to Passive Perception.</p>
<p><b><i>Polearm Master.</i></b> When you take the Attack action and attack with only a polearm or a quarterstaff, you can use a quick action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon, dealing 2 crushing damage on a hit. While you are wielding a polearm or a quarterstaff, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.</p>
<p><b><i>Resilient.</i></b> Gain proficiency in Firmness, Reflex, Endurance, Warding, Intuition, or Will.</p>
<p><b><i>Savage Attacker.</i></b> Once per turn when you deal melee damage, add 1 for one-handed weapons, and 2 for two-handed weapons.</p>
<p><b><i>Sentinel.</i></b> When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn. Creatures within 1 square of you provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action. When a creature within 1 square of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking crealure.</p>
<p><b><i>Sharpshooter.</i></b> When attacking with a ranged weapon, you ignore half cover and treat three-quarters cover as half cover. Further, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to hit chance and gain +25% to damage (rounded up).</p>
<p><b><i>Spell Sniper.</i></b> When you cast a spell that attacks Deflection, the spell's range is doubled. Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and treat three-quarters cover as half cover.</p>
<p><b><i>Stealthy.</i></b> You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding. When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, you still remain hidden. If you are hidden, you can move up to 2 squares in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you’re not clearly visible.</p>
<p><b><i>Tough.</i></b> Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hp.</p>
<p><b><i>War Caster.</i></b> You have advantage on Constitution rolls to maintain concentration on a spell. You can cast spells even when both your hands are occupied with weapons or shield. When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunily attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.</p>


<br/><h1 id="characterCreation">Creating a Character</h1>
<h4>Step 1: Choose a Class</h4>
<p>Every adventurer comes from a certain background, and has undergone a certain type of training (whether formal or not), thus obtaining a basic set of skills that, throughout one's trials and tribulations, will be further honed in the same general direction. This set of skills is called a class, and the are 12 paths to choose from: <a href="classes/barbarian.html">Berserker</a>, <a href="classes/bard.html">Bard</a>, <a href="classes/cleric.html">Cleric</a>, <a href="classes/druid.html">Druid</a>, <a href="classes/fighter.html">Fighter</a>, <a href="classes/monk.html">Monk</a>, <a href="classes/paladin.html">Paladin</a>, <a href="classes/ranger.html">Ranger</a>, <a href="classes/rogue.html">Rogue</a>, <a href="classes/sorcerer.html">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="classes/warlock.html">Warlock</a>, or <a href="classes/wizard.html">Wizard</a>. You cannot change or alter your class during the game, but there are different paths to choose from in each class, and there is enough flexibility to allow several interesting variations for the same class.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Choose a Race</h4>
<p>Choose one of the following races (including sub-race if multiple choices available): <a href="races/dragonborn.html">Dragonborn</a>, <a href="races/dwarf.html">Dwarf</a>, <a href="races/elf.html">Elf</a>, <a href="races/gnome.html">Gnome</a>, <a href="races/half_elf.html">Half-Elf</a>, <a href="races/halfling.html">Halfling</a>, <a href="races/half_orc.html">Half-Orc</a>, <a href="races/human.html">Human</a>, <a href="races/highman.html">Highman</a>, <a href="races/kenku.html">Kenku</a>, <a href="races/lizardfolk.html">Lizardfolk</a>, <a href="races/tiefling.html">Tiefling</a>, or <a href="races/tigran.html">Tigran</a>. Every race (and sub-race) has its peculiarities and inclinations, which you may wish to consider for roleplaying purposes. More practically, the chosen race determines your character's general appearance, base speed, the languages he/she can speak, as well as a number of racial traits, which provide miscellaneous benefits. Some races may provide adjustments to your attributes; keep these in mind for step 3.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Determine Attributes</h4>
<p>The attributes for your character are determined using a point buy system. You start with 4 points which you can spend however you like to buy your character's six attributes, according to the following table. Remember to add your chosen race's attribute modifiers.</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Score</th><th>-2</th><th>-1</th><th>+0</th><th>+1</th><th>+2</th><th>+3</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Cost</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>+0</td><td>+1</td><td>+2</td><td>+4</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Step 4: Choose your character's proficiencies</h4>
<p>You get to choose 5 + Intelligence proficiencies: skills, weapons, instruments, and languages other than those your race starts with. You have no restrictions on what you can become proficient in, but you should prepare a background that explains how you came by that knowledge.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Your character's background and personality</h4>
<p>You have now chosen everything needed for the mechanics of the game, but you should also spend some time fleshing out a background and personality for your character, so that they are more than just a pile of stats. AD&amp;D might be primarily about adventuring and overcoming various challenges, but it is also a roleplaying game that enables you to act out fantasy characters in a fantasy world. You needn't write too much, even a few lines might suffice to give context to your character's decision and make the game more immersive for everyone. The only requirement for your background information is that it doesn't contradict game lore or mechanics (for example, you can't have a lazy forgetful wizard, since their power comes from intensive study &mdash; exceptions are subject to GM approval).</p>
<p>If in doubt or lacking inpiration, consult the GM. It is not required to have everything about a character set in stone at the start; you can also add details as the adventure unfolds, though within the limits of common sense (so for example, it is not acceptable to say an NPC is suddenly a relative of your character).</p>
<p>Remember that the most important thing is for you and everyone at the table to have fun. Choose a personality and story that would be interesting and synergizes well with your party members. Never choose something that is deliberately antagonistic to another character unless <b>everyone</b> at the table agrees to this. Also, remember that the character's attributes define raw physical and mental ability, and have nothing to do with intelligence or personality unless you specifically choose to interpret it this way.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are now done and ready to play!</p>
<h4>Alternative: Hardcore Rules</h4>
<p>For players who want a little more randomness in their game, or simply wish it to be more challenging, they can opt for the following alternative rules. These hardcore rules risk unbalacing the game and the party (a character may be stronger than the rest, and some characters may be significantly weaker/stronger than average). In the interest of fairness, it is recommended that the entire party be either normal or hardcore, and exceptions should only be made with the approval of all the players and the GM.</p>
<p><b><i>Determining Attributes.</i></b> Instead of point-buy, roll 6 d6s. Assign each resulting number to the attribute of your choice, then subtract 3.</p>
<p><b><i>HP gain on level up.</i></b> Instead of a fixed gain, you must roll your hit die to determine your hp increase.</p>


<br/><h1 id="encounters">Encounters</h1>
<p>In encounter play, characters are making moment-by-moment decisions and taking very short actions (each taking up just a few seconds). They may or may not be following an initiative order. These include various sub-modes of play like combat, chase scenes, action scenes, and social interactions.</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Determine what each side intends to achieve and how it intends to achieve it.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Describe the environment and opposing sides; if combat is likely and the environment is complex, place the combatants and other important features on a grid.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> If any creature initiates a hostile or time-sensitive action, roll initiative.</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> Determine what creatures (if any) are surprised.</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> In descending order of initiative, each character takes its turn, until the conflict is resolved.</p>
<h4>Surprise</h4>
<p>A creature is considered to be surprised if it fails to spot any of the incoming attackers (either because the creature cannot physically sense them, or because the attackes had a successful Stealth roll against this creature's Passive Perception). A surprised character can't take any action, quick action, free action, or reaction, on the first turn of combat.</p>
<h4>Initiative</h4>
<p>Every creature rolls Dexterity to determine its initiative. Large groups of weak NPC monsters can be assigned a single initiative roll by a hurried GM. If an NPC and PC, or two PCs, are tied, roll another d20 for each to determine who has the higher initiative. The GM breaks ties between NPCs. The GM should assign numbers (or nicknames) to identical monsters in order to keep track of their individual initiative and health.</p>
<h4>Damage Types</h4>
<p>There are 13 damage types in the game, each marked with a special color when mentioned (for increased visibility):</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="acid">acid</span> &mdash; refers to any type of corrosive substance</li>
  <li><span class="cold">cold</span> &mdash; is the numbing touch of frost</li>
  <li><span class="crsh">crushing</span> &mdash; blunt force trauma</li>
  <li><span class="fire">fire</span> &mdash; is flame or extreme heat</li>
  <li><span class="forc">force</span> &mdash; is raw magical energy, against which only raw magic can defend</li>
  <li><span class="elec">electric</span> &mdash; known as lightning to the uneducated, it has a host of interesting properties wizards are only beginning to understand</li>
  <li><span class="necr">necrotic</span> &mdash; death energy from the Shadowfell</li>
  <li><span class="pier">piercing</span> &mdash; arrows, javelins and spears pierce the flesh</li>
  <li><span class="pois">poison</span> &mdash; biological substance that is harmful to most living creatures</li>
  <li><span class="psyc">psychic</span> &mdash; damage caused to the mind</li>
  <li><span class="radi">radiant</span> &mdash; concentrated positive energy from either the Feywild or a Deity, it can sear the flesh of living creatures</li>
  <li><span class="slsh">slashing</span> &mdash; cutting damage, done by swords and axes</li>
  <li><span class="soni">sonic</span> &mdash; produced by a concussive burst of sound, it is uniquely suited to pierce even the thickest of armors</li>
</ul>
<h4>Facing</h4>
<p>Most creatures can only see (and therefore fight against) things in a front arc. By default, the front arc consists of all squares in front of, or to the side of, the creature. The rest of the squares form the rear arc. Exceptions to this rule must be explicitly stated.</p>
<p>Facing is first determined when initiative is rolled. Afterwards, every time a creature willingly moves, and before each separate attack, it can choose a new facing. A creature can also spend its reaction to change its facing, in response to the movement of a creature it is aware of (you cannot change your facing when an invisible or stealthed opponent moves), or in response to a melee attack by a creature you are aware of.</p>
<p>Keeping track of facing is very important, because attacks against a creature made from its rear arc have advantage.</p>
<h4>A Character's Turn</h4>
<p>A turn represents a period of 6 seconds, during which characters act almost simultaneously, with some starting their action faster than others (determined by the initiative order). During its turn, a character can move, take an action, a quick action, and/or a free action, mixed in any order.</p>
<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>A character can move during its turn up to its maximum speed. Movement can be interspersed with actions (regular, quick, or free) in all possible permutations, so long as the character doesn't exceed its movement speed. If a character can attack twice, for example, it can move, attack, move, attack again, and still move if it has movement speed left.</p>
<p>If a character has several types of movement (eg. land and fly), it can switch between these two types at will. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>
<p>Movement can be diagonal, however it can't cross the corner of an obstacle that occupies it's entire square. Furthermore, every 3 diagonal moves cost an additional square.</p>
<p><b><i>Difficult terrain.</i></b> If terrain is classified as difficult (rubble, stairs, mud), then movement is twice as expensive (spend two squares to move one). A space occupied by a creature always counts as difficult. You cannot move half a square.</p>
<p><b><i>Prone.</i></b> You can drop prone for no cost. Standing up costs half of your movement speed, however. You can't stand up if you don't have enough speed remaining or if your speed is 0. While prone, you can move only through crawling, which costs an extra meter for every meter traversed (so in difficult terrain you spend 3m to move 1m).</p>
<p><b><i>Moving around other creatures.</i></b> It is permitted to move through squares occupied by friendly creatures. You can only move through a space occupied by a hostile creature if you are either larger, or two sizes smaller. You aren't allowed to willingly end your turn in an occupied space.</p>
<p><b><i>Squeezing.</i></b> A creature can squeeze through a space that's sufficient for a creature one size smaller, but it counts as difficult terrain and it has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and attacks against its Deflection or Reflex have advantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Flying movement.</i></b> If a flying creature is knocked prone, stunned, incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 or it otherwise loses its ability to stay in the air, then the creature falls to the ground, taking falling damage if appropriate. Creatures that hover don't suffer from this problem.</p>
<p><b><i>Creature size.</i></b> Tiny creatures control only a quarter of a square; therefore, up to four of them can occupy the same square at once. Small and medium creatures control a whole square. Large creatures control a 2x2 area, huge creatures 3x3, and gargantuan creatures 4x4 or, in rare cases, even more. At the GM's discretion, combat against a creature 2 sizes larger or more may follow special rules, such as requiring melee characters to climb their foe in order to be able to strike somewhere where it hurts.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>Unless special feats dictate otherwise, a character can only take one of these options during a turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Attack.</i></b> Make an attack with a weapon or natural ability of the character. Check the description of the attack you plan to use for information on how many attacks are permitted, the roll modifier, and the damage inflicted if the attack succeeds. On a critical success, the attack deals 50% more damage (rounded up), while on a partial success the attack is a graze and deals 50% less damage.</p>
<p>For each attack that you make you can choose a different target. Furthermore, instead of using the attack as described, you can use one of the following alternatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Heavy attack.</b> Can only be used with a melee weapon. You make the widest swing, intending to deal a killing blow - useful against opponents that are open to attack and easy to hit. You take a -5 penalty to the attack roll, but on a hit you deal 25% more damage (rounded up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Feint.</b> Can only be used with a melee weapon. You fake an attack with the intention of creating an opening in your opponent's defenses. The next melee attack from you or one of your allies made before the start of your next turn has advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Grapple.</b> The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, it must be within your reach, and you must have a free hand with which to seize the target. Roll Strength (Athletics) vs Firmness. If you succeed, the target is <a href="conditions/grappled.html">grappled</a>. You can release the target as a free action. You can also use a second free hand in order to <a href="conditions/restrained.html">restrain</a> your enemy. You do not have advantage on attack rolls against the creature you are grappling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shove.</b> The enemy must be no more than one size larger than you, and he must be within your reach. Roll Strength (Athletics) vs Firmness. If you succeed, you can either push the enemy 1 square away or knock him <a href="conditions/prone.html">prone</a>. You have advantage if you have the high ground (at least half a meter above your foe). You have disadvantage if the enemy has the high ground. If you carry a shield, a successful shove also deals 2 crushing damage.</p>
<p id="dualWield">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dual wielding.</b> Attack with a [light] or [thrown] weapon that you're holding in one hand, then use your quick action to attack with a different [light] weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your attribute modifier to the damage of this extra attack, unless that modifier is negative. If a weapon has the [loading] tag, then it cannot be reloaded while you continue to dual wield.</p>
<p><b><i>Cast a spell.</i></b> See the spell description for the time it takes to cast the spell. Some spells use a quick action, or a reaction, most require one action, while others consume actions over a certain number of rounds. See the <a href="#spellcasting">spellcasting</a> section for more information.</p>
<p><b><i>Dash.</i></b> Double your movement speed for this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Disengage.</i></b> Your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity on this turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Dodge.</i></b> Until your next turn, attacks made against your Deflection or Reflex have disadvantage. You lose this bonus if you are <a href="conditions/incapacitated.html">incapacitated</a> or your speed drops to 0.</p>
<p><b><i>Hide.</i></b> You can only hide if you are heavily obscured or not visible to any of your opponents. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) roll; all creatures with a Passive Perception lower than your roll will no longer be able to see you so long as you remain at least lightly obscured. If one creature from a group spots you in hiding, it will shout out this information to all the others as soon as its turn comes up. You can still be heard and smelled while hiding; if you make a distinctive noise, or pass next to an enemy, then you must repeat your Stealth roll to continue fooling them. When attacking an unaware foe from stealth you have advantage on rolls vs Deflection.</p>
<p><b><i>Ready.</i></b> You prepare to take a reaction contingent on a trigger. You state what the trigger is ('the goblin moves on the trapdoor') and what your action will be ('I pull the trapdoor lever'). If the trigger occurs until the start of your next turn, you may use your reaction (if not already consumed) to enact your statement.</p>
<p>If you're readying a spell this way, then your character is keeping it energized, ready to be released when the trigger occurs. This means maintaining <a href="#concentration">concentration</a>. If your concentration is broken, the spell is lost. Only spells that have a casting time of 1 action can be used in this way.</p>
<p>You cannot Ready an action outside a combat situation; for example, you cannot guarantee to shoot someone as soon as they open a door, initiative must still be decided.</p>
<p><b><i>Use Object.</i></b> Interact with an object, like drinking or administering a potion, pulling a lever, swinging on a rope, etc.</p>
<p><b><i>Improvise!</i></b> You can be creative and have your character do anything that is in his/her power to accomplish within the 6 seconds of a round.</p>
<h4>Quick Actions</h4>
<p>Some abilities or spells that are particularly swift require only a quick action instead of a regular action. You can only take one quick action during your turn.</p>
<h4>Free actions</h4>
<p>Simple actions, such as opening a door, (un)sheathing your sword, dropping an object you are holding, signaling your allies, or uttering a short phrase are free and can be done at any time during your turn. You can only take one free action during your turn.</p>
<h4>Reactions</h4>
<p>Between the end of your turn and the start of your next turn, you get one reaction, which is a short response to some trigger. Some abilities are employed during a reaction; the most common example is the attack of opportunity. The Ready action also makes use of the reaction.</p>
<p><b><i>Opportunity attack.</i></b> If you move out of an opponent's melee reach, and your starting point was in its front arc, then that opponent can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack on you (following the rules of a regular melee attack). You don't provoke an opportunity attack if you are moved by an external force (such as a shove, or an explosion), because it's too sudden a movement for the average opponent to react to it.</p>
<h4>Ranged attacks</h4>
<p><b><i>Range.</i></b> If a ranged attack has a single distance noted, you can't attack targets beyond this range. If there are two distances, the smaller number is the normal range and the other is the long range, beyond which you can't attack. If you attack targets beyond the normal range, you roll with disadvantage.</p>
<p><b><i>Ranged weapons in melee.</i></b> If you are within melee range of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, and you are in its front arc, then your ranged attack rolls have disadvantage.</p>
<h4>Cover</h4>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies. Cover bonuses don't apply to area of effect spells, unless the cover stands between the creature and the center of the effect. An object provides cover only if it is between a target and its attacker.</p>
<p><b><i>Half cover.</i></b> Provides +2 to Deflection and Reflex. A target has half cover if an obstacle covers at least half of its body. Standing behind a creature your size or one size bigger counts as half cover. At the GM's discretion, a failure with 1 or 2 can force an attack against the covering creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Three-quarters cover.</i></b> Provides +5 to Deflection and Reflex. A target has 3/4 cover if an obstacle covers at least 3/4 of its body.</p>
<p><b><i>Full cover.</i></b> Can't be targeted directly by ranged attacks or spells. A target has full cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>
<h4>Damage resistance and vulnerability</h4>
<p>If a creature has <b>resistance</b> to a damage type, then damage from that source is halved. Conversely, <b>vulnerability</b> doubles damage from that source. This multiplier is applied only after all other damage modifiers have already been factored in. Neither resistance nor vulnerability to a damage type can be stacked.</p>
<h4>Knocking a creature out</h4>
<p>When an attacker reduces an opponent to 0 hp with any melee attack (weapon, spell, or unarmed), it can choose to knock out instead of harming the target. The creature falls unconscious and doesn't take any injuries, but still loses 1 Health.</p>
<h4>Temporary hit points</h4>
<p>Temporary hp is separate from normal hp. It can't be healed by any means, it doesn't stack (so if you are affected by two boons providing temporary hp, you must choose one of them) and it is always the first to absorb damage. If you have 0 hp, then temporary hp doesn't remove the <a href="conditions/bloodied.html">bloodied</a> condition.</p>
<p>Unless the feature that granted you temporary hp has a duration, they last until they are depleted or until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4>Instant kills</h4>
<p>If a creature is completely at ease (does not think itself in any peril) or sleeping, or otherwise incapacitated and unable to defend itself, it can be killed in one blow, provided that an attacker satisfies these following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>can reach a vulnerable part of that creature with a lethal weapon (eg. a humanoid's neck with a bladed weapon)</li>
  <li>can approach the target undetected with a Roll Dexterity (Stealth) vs Passive Perception (-5 for sleeping creatures, automatic critical success if creature completely unable to sense its attacker)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a critical success you kill your target in complete silence. On a success, you kill your target but its death throes can be heard within 4 squares, unless there is some other source of noise. On a partial success, you kill your target, but it yells for help, which is clearly audible for 30m.</p>
<h4>Vulnerable body part</h4>
<p>Foes may have some body part that is both important to combat functions and quite vulnerable. For example, humanoid creatures have arms and legs that, if cut off, impair their combat capacity. The heart, or head, while definitely of supreme importance, are however not vulnerable, as they are always the best defended parts of a body (unless otherwise specified).</p>
<p>A creature can specifically target such a body part, with a disadvantage on the attack roll. The attack deals damage to both the body part and the body itself. If the creature is healed, then it can choose to also apply that healing on a damaged body part. If not otherwise specified, the body part defaults to a quarter of the health of the body. If the body part is reduced to 0hp then it is destroyed, and cannot be healed through ordinary means; furthermore, all abilities granted by that body part are immediately lost.</p>
<p>Vulnerable parts are usually specified in a monster's description, but the GM can accept improvisation on this front if it makes sense. For example, all humanoids rely on their right arm to fight; if destroyed, they may attempt to fight with their left (if at all possible), but at a disadvantage, and only after picking up their weapon. If a leg is destroyed, then movement speed is halved. If both legs are destroyed, then the creature is stuck in prone (this stacks with the halved movement speed).</p>
<h4>Mounted combat</h4>
<p>To mount or dismount, you need to spend half of your movement points (this is impossible to do if your speed is 0).</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will, or it would knock you prone while mounted, then you must Roll Strength (Athletics/Acrobatics) or be knocked off the mount, landing prone in a square next to it.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land gracefully in a square next to it. Otherwise, you fall prone in a square next to the mount.</p>
<p>If the mount is intelligent, then it acts independently (although, of course, it can coordinate with its rider if it is so inclined). It has its own spot in the initiative order, and its possibilities are in no way limited by the rider on its back (within the limits of common decency). Conversely, a domesticated and trained mount will act during your turn, with one of these actions: Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.</p>
<p>If a mount provokes an attack of opportunity, then the enemy can attack either you or your mount.</p>
<h4>Underwater combat</h4>
<p>Unless a creatures has a specified swimming speed, every square of movement costs two instead. When a creature without swimming speed makes a melee attack with a weapon other than a dagger, short sword, javelin, spear or trident, it suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls.</p>
<p>A ranged attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even within the normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless it's a crossbow, a net, a javelin, a thrown spear, or a dart.</p>
<p>Fully submerged creatures have resistance to fire damage.</p>
<h4>Combat against mobs</h4>
<p>Some foes are so outmatched that only sheer numbers can hope to even the scales in their favor. In order to ease bookkeeping in such situations, these foes are handled as a mob.</p>
<p>The mob moves and acts all at once, and it can occupy several squares (loosen the restriction for one Medium creature per square if needed). Damage is applied to the mob as a whole, and several individuals can be killed with one attack. When attacking, determine the d20 roll an individual creature would need to hit. If it's 1-5, apply damage for every individual in the mob; if 6-12, for every 2; if 13-14, for every 3; if 15-16, for every 4; if 17-18, for every 5; if 19, for every 10; if 20, for every 20.</p>
<h4 id="socialInteract">Social Interaction</h4>
<p>It may be the case that the person you're interacting with has objections to helping you out. If that's the case, then the PCs must somehow overcome these objections (convince the person).</p>
<p>The NPC starts with one or more objections, each with a score assigned, defining how strong the objection is. To surpass these objections, the PCs must either address an objection (thus lowering its score) OR provide an incentive to help. The better the argument, the greater the score it has. But to carry this argument across, a PC has to rely on Persuasion or Intimidation (the latter can only be used to provide an incentive of fear – although it is only useful when the person being threatened has something to fear from the PCs). Both sides may employ falsehood or misinformation in the discussion (if you're convinced a false statement is true, it's not lying). In this case, success is determined by a roll of Deception vs Passive Insight.</p>
<p>The NPC is convinced if the score of the incentives equals or surpasses the score of the objections. However, particularly bad arguments or discovered lies can instead increase the strength of objections; a character may choose to end the conversation if the objections become too strong or if the conversation stalls for too long. Also, if the PCs make a particularly offensive remark and it isn't addressed promptly and satisfactorily (if it is even possible), then the conversation also ends.</p>
<p>Some characters may have particular likes or dislikes, which can produce an advantage or disadvantage in the ability checks. For example, a knight might be flattered with praise of his honor and fighting skills, or a racist dwarf might dislike talking to elves.</p>
<p>Some characters may hold to an objection fanatically, thus it's score cannot be lowered by any argument. (For example, a priest is probably fanatically convinced of the philosophy of his Deity) Thus, the only way to convince such a person is to provide matching incentives.</p>
<p>If the conversation is such that small talk is appropriate, then a roll of Insight vs Passive Deception can provide the party with some information on a character's objections.</p>


<br/><h1 id="exploration">Exploration</h1>
<p>Exploration lacks the quick pace and tension of combat, though sudden surprises and setbacks can happen. It generally covers a timespan measured in tens of minutes. Players will generally spend a few minutes on an individual task, or they may be moving from scene to scene during exploration, as in exploring a dungeon complex, or they may be playing out an extended single scene, such as stealthily infiltrating an enemy stronghold.</p>
<h4>Exploration actions</h4>
<p>As is normal, once a player declares an action, the GM determines whether the action can succeed or fail and determines whether an ability check is required. The GM should also determine whether the action is immediate and also whether the action is quiet or noisy. If the description of the action doesn’t make that obvious, the GM should ask questions of the player to determine those answers.</p>
<p>If the action is immediate, the action is resolved on the spot, using the Core Mechanic. If the action was loud, the GM <a href="#complications">Rolls for Complications</a>. Arguing loudly over the course of action counts as a loud, non-immediate action.</p>
<p>If the action is not immediate, however, the GM should let the other players know that the character is engaged in an action that will take a few minutes and ask what the other players are doing during this time. This should be done before the non-immediate action is resolved. If any players undertake immediate actions at this point or ask questions, they should be dealt with immediately. If any players declare actions that aren’t immediate, those actions should be held. Once all the players are committed to non-immediate actions or to waiting for their allies to finish their tasks, the GM should resolve each non-immediate task in turn and then <a href="#advanceTime">Advance Time</a>. If any of the actions were loud, the GM should <a href="#complications">Roll for Complications</a>.</p>
<p><i>Example: The party enters an ancient study. There is a book chained to a lectern in the middle of the room, an ancient desk, and a bookshelf filled with aging books. Unbeknownst to the party, there is also a strongbox sitting on the floor behind the desk. Any player in the vicinity of the desk will notice it immediately. Alice says, “I want to go check out that book on the lectern.” The GM explains that it is a leather-bound book, aged, but intact. The cover has a padlock, locking it closed, and it is secured via a chain to the lectern. Alice wants to investigate the book further. The GM asks what she means. She says she suspects the book might be protected by a trap of some kind. She’d like to be sure it’s safe before she tries to unlock it. The GM says “that will take several minutes, okay? While Alice is doing that, what do the rest of you do?” Bob says he’d like to go over and examine the desk. The GM says “as you approach the desk, you notice a metal strongbox on the floor beside it. It is closed with a padlock.” Bob says “I want to try to pry open the padlock with my crowbar.” The GM nods and says “that will also take a few minutes. You can do that while Alice is looking for traps.” Carol says, “I’m just going to keep watch.” Dave says, “I’ll go look through the books on the bookshelf. I’ll see if I can find anything valuable or unusual.” Now that Alice, Bob, and Dave are committed to non-immediate actions and Carol is waiting for them to finish, the GM can resolve each action in turn. The GM determines that none of the actions are loud. The GM Advances Time and then resolves each of the actions in turn. And then asks the party what they want to do next.</i></p>
<h4>Extended Tasks</h4>
<p>In general, an exploration task should take no longer than ten minutes. However, some very complicated tasks can take an extended period of time. The GM can determine, for example, that an extremely complex, ancient lock might take longer to pick. During that time, the party might attract attention and complications may arise.</p>
<p>When designing an extended task, a GM should determine how much time the task requires in terms of actions. Each action Advances Time once and, if the action is noisy, may cause a Roll for Complications. Obviously, during this time, other characters may engage in actions as described above or they can simply wait. If the action does not require a die roll, the GM merely Advances Time for each required action and, if necessary, Rolls for Complications. If the action does require a die roll, the GM Advances Time and Rolls for Complications for each action as normal, but if the die roll is a failure, the character makes no progress. Thus, they may have to attempt further actions in order to complete the task. Of course, if the action takes too long, the party may decide to give up. Particularly if complications arise.</p>
<h4>Time Pool</h4>
<p>The Time Pool is an approximation of the time that elapses as the party partakes in lengthy actions. The Time Pool is a pile of 0 to 5 tokens that is visible to all the players and the GM. Each token in the pool indicates that 10 minutes of game time have passed.</p>
<p id="advanceTime">Whenever the party is engaged in one or more non-instantaneous exploration tasks as described above, or whenever they move from location to location within the dungeon, or whenever they engage in an activity that takes between one and ten minutes (such as casting a spell as a ritual), the GM Advances Time. The GM may also Advance Time if the party is staying in one place debating their actions for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>When Time Advances, any effect with 10 minutes or less remaining of its duration expires. Other durations are not effected. The GM then adds a single token to the Time Pool. If multiple characters undertook simultaneous exploration tasks, the GM adds only a single token to the Time Pool. However, the GM does not add a token to the Time Pool if there are already five tokens in the Time Pool. Instead, the Time Pool is <a href="#timepoolClear">Cleared</a>.</p>
<h4 id="complications">Rolling for Complications</h4>
<p>Elements of the adventure could also call for a Roll for Complications as determined by the GM or the adventure designer. For example, if the party sets off an alarm trap or if a goblin prisoner starts screaming for help, the adventure could call on the GM to Roll for Complications.</p>
<p>To Roll for Complications, the GM rolls a number of dice equal to the number of tokens currently in the Time Pool. In most normal situations, the GM will roll d6s. However, in less dangerous or more sparsely populated environments, the GM could use d8s. And in extremely dangerous environments, the GM could use d4s.</p>
<p>Various factors in the adventure could change the size of the dice used when Rolling for Complications. For example, if the party invades a kobold lair during the day – when most of the kobolds are sleeping – the Complication Dice might only be d8s. But if they come back at night, those dice become d6s. And if some kobolds manage to escape from a battle and raise the alarm, those dice might become d4s. Again, GMs and adventure designers are encouraged to use the Complication mechanic creatively to add different elements to their adventures.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number and size of the Complication Dice, if any die shows a 1, a Complication occurs. The GM should remove one token from the Time Pool and then resolve the Complication. Otherwise, nothing happens.</p>
<p>If the GM is ever required to Roll for Complications when there are no tokens in the Time Pool, the GM should roll one Complication Die. If it shows a 1, a Complication arises. Otherwise, nothing happens.</p>
<h4>Complications</h4>
<p>A Complication is a random event, setback, or encounter that befalls the party. They are prescribed by the adventure, but the GM can invent new ones on the fly. The most common Complications are random encounters with creatures wandering around the dungeon. In general, such an encounter should be an encounter of Easy difficulty for the party’s level or even easier. Such encounters should be nuisances rather than serious threats. Complications should never reward players with any XP.</p>
<p>Wandering creatures do not have to be hostile, though outright friendly creatures should be exceedingly rare. Other random events can include geological events, minor traps and hazards that risk a few hit points of damage or impose a condition on an unlucky PC, or the like.</p>
<p>GMs or adventure designers are welcome to design whatever Complications serve the theme of the adventure. But Complications should not be terribly complex. A random encounter should include only one or two types of creatures with clear, simple motivations. Other random events should not be more complex than a single event that the party can react to. In general, for each adventuring day that the GM or designer expects the party to spend exploring the site, there should be at least four but no more than six possible Complications. They could be organized on a random table or the GM can simply choose an appropriate one.</p>
<p>Specific locations can also have specific Complications keyed to them. For example, in the cave of sulfurous geysers, a Complication can always result in a spray of noxious gases from one of the geysers. An adventure designer could also instruct a GM to Roll for Complications each time the party passes through the Sulfurous Geyser Cave. Complications and Rolls for Complications should be used in this way to create special effects that help bring a dungeon to life and all sorts of random events can key off of this system.</p>
<h4 id="timepoolClear">Clearing the Time Pool</h4>
<p>After all effects with 10 minutes or less remaining of their durations expires as normal for Advancing Time, any effect with an hour or less remaining of its duration expires. Any effect with a duration greater than one hour remaining has one hour subtracted from its remaining duration. Then, the GM Rolls for Complications regardless of whether any attempted actions were loud or rushed. The GM should only roll six dice and not add any for the final advancement of time that caused the Time Pool to clear. Whether a Complication occurs or not, the GM then removes all tokens from the Time Pool.</p>
<h4>Short Rest</h4>
<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend available Hit Dice at the end of a short rest. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hp equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.</p>
<p>The Time Pool remains untouched after a Short Rest, but the GM will Roll for Complications with six dice.</p>
<h4>Long Rest</h4>
<p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity (reading, talking, eating, or standing watch) for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a long rest, all tokens are cleared from the Time Pool (but this doesn't trigger a <a href="#timepoolClear">Clear</a>). After a Long Rest, a character regains all lost hp. The character also regains half of its maximum Hit Dice (but can't exceed this maximum). A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hp at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
<h4>Long Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can jump over 4m + 0.5m * Strength. If you make a standing jump, then you can clear only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. If the landing is contested by an enemy, roll Dexterity (Acrobatics) vs enemy Reflex to determine whether you can safely land or whether you fall.</p>
<h4>Height Jump</h4>
<p>If you run for at least 3m, then you can leap into the air 1m + 0.25m * Strength. If you make a standing jump, then you can leap only half that distance. For purposes of movement speed in a turn, every meter jumped counts as a meter of normal movement. Since you jump with your hands up, you can reach a ledge as high as jump height + 1.5 * character height.</p>
<h4>Marching Order</h4>
<p>The party must, at all times, have a well established marching order (the formation in which the characters march). When going through tight spaces, the marching order may have to change. The party must establish a default marching order (including who takes point if the situation demands it) and announce changes if and when it is deemed necessary. This is so that the GM doesn't have to ask for a marching order when it's needed, thus potentially tipping off the party than an encounter or trap is imminent.</p>
<h4>Vision and light</h4>
<p><b><i>Lightly obscured.</i></b> An area in dim light, fog, or covered with foliage. Characters trying to see something located in such an area have disadvantage on Perception checks relying on sight. Passive Perception is reduced by 5 for elements in such an area that can only be seen, not heard (such as traps). Passive Perception is reduced by 3 for elements in such an area that can also be heard (such as a sneaking creature).</p>
<p><b><i>Heavily obscured.</i></b> This area is not visible to a character, either because it is not in the line of sight, or because it is covered in darkness or thick fog. The character doesn't see into this area and treats objects in it as invisible. If the character is inside an area that is heavily obscured to it, then it is effectively <a href="conditions/blinded.html">blind</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Bright light.</i></b> Unless a trait specifies otherwise, any creature can see clearly. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns and fires, within a specific radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Dim light.</i></b> Also called shadow, areas in dim light are considered lightly obscured. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. Nights with a visible moon, and twilight and dawn where the sun is yet to be fully visible count as dim light.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkness</i></b> creates a heavily obscured area. The complete absence of light sources creates darkness.</p>
<p><b><i>Blindsight.</i></b> The creature can clearly perceive the environment without the use of eyes, in the given radius.</p>
<p><b><i>Duskvision.</i></b> Out to a specified range, the creature sees in dim light as if it were bright light.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Out to a specified range, the creature sees in dim light as if it were bright light and it sees in darkness as if it were dim light, although it can't distinguish colors in darkness.</p>
<p><b><i>Truesight.</i></b> A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions (thus being immune to any effects from them), and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<h4>Nourishment</h4>
<p>A character needs half a kg of food per day and can go without food for a period equal to 3 + max(Constitution, 1) days. For every subsequent day without food, the character takes one level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>A character needs to drink 2 liters of water (or an appropriate substitute) per day, or 4 liters if the weather is hot. If a character drinks only half the required water, DC 15 Constitution or take a level of exhaustion. If even less water is available, then the character automatically takes a level of exhaustion, two if the character is already exhausted.</p>
<p>For every size above Medium, a character consumes twice as much food and water. A Tiny character's consumption is halved, on the other hand.</p>


<br/><h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>
<p>During travel, the characters are moving from place to play over an extended period. They choose actions that may cover hours or even days of game time and they generally keep to them until something happens.</p>
<h4>Traveling through wilderness</h4>
<p>The world of D&amp;D is a dangerous one, and travel often involves great peril for the party, even more so in wilderness, where there is a danger of getting lost or low on food after days of wandering. The following rules only apply in situations where there is a significant risk of hostile encounters, or of a comparable loss of resources.</p>
<p>For any travel, the following factors are determined by the GM: Danger, Navigation, Resources and Discoveries. These factors can be gleaned by the players from research or interactions with NPCs, but will never be explicitly stated. Note that these factors need not be constant for the whole trip. The gentle meadow might give way to a treacherous forest filled with goblins.</p>
<p><b><i>Danger.</i></b> An estimate of how many random encounters are expected in a day of travel. It is 1 for regions regularly policed by a civilized faction or barren locations with few creatures; 2 for untamed wilderness; 3 for enemy territory (inhabited by intelligent and hostile creatures); 4 for regularly patrolled enemy territory; 5 for territory filled with monsters that can easily detect intruders and are actively trying to stop them (this is reserved for the most extreme of environments, such as Hell).</p>
<p><b><i>Navigation.</i></b> A measure of how difficult it is to find and follow landmarks. It will be used as DC, and so it ranges from 0 to 30 (or beyond in rare, extreme circumstances). If the party must follow a road, or a river, this is 0, but if it must navigate a treacherous desert, it is instead 30.</p>
<p><b><i>Resources.</i></b> A measure of how difficult it is to forage for food and water. It will be used as a DC, and so it ranges from 0 in lush river lands, to 30 in deserts, to 99 in environments that are completely barren.</p>
<p><b><i>Discovery.</i></b> The chance to stumble across something interesting in the distance, that the party might want to explore. A discovery generally contains some reward for the party.</p>
<p><b><i>Pace.</i></b> At the beginning of each day, the party must decide at what pace to travel: slow, normal or fast. This decision can be revisited at any point, affecting the total traveled for the day accordingly. At a slow pace, a party travels only 2/3 the normal distance, but it moves stealthily and carefully, providing them with advantage on Perception and Navigation checks; conversely, enemies suffer disadvantage on Perception checks to spot the party. At a normal pace the party suffers disadvantage on Forage checks. At a fast pace, the party has no possibility to forage, it suffers disadvantage on Perception and Navigation checks and enemies have advantage on Perception checks to spot the party.</p>
<p>At the beginning of every day of travel, the GM secretly rolls six d6, one for every time of day: morning, afternoon, evening, dusk, midnight, predawn. For each one that shows the Danger number or less, an encounter <i>might</i> happen. The GM also rolls another d6; if it is equal or lower to the Discovery number, a tantalizing opportunity will present itself during the day.</p>
<p>Now, for each encounter that might happen, check for who spots whom and run it accordingly. Since neither party might notice the other, it is possible for such an encounter to not happen at all. Encounters need not be battles; they can also be traps, puzzles, interesting choices etc. A short rest is always assumed to have happened before encounters.</p>
<p>Once the encounters for daytime (morning to dusk) are done, the party sets camp to get some sleep. They can also set camp sooner, but that would waste what remains of the day. The party can also choose to press on without setting camp and thus increase the distance traveled by half, but they immediately take a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p>When the day ends, the GM does the bookkeeping for the previous day. First, determine if the party is lost by rolling (in secret) with the bonuses of the best navigator against the Navigation DC. Failure means the party is lost (they just don't know it yet). If the party isn't lost, register the amount traveled during the day as progress (no progress otherwise). Progress, as well as travel time, is measured in days. If the party spent some time on a discovery, subtract an appropriate number from their progress (usually 1/3).</p>
<p>If lost, a subsequent successful Navigation roll will reveal that the party has been lost (and for how long). Progress will be accumulated once again. At the GM's discretion, the party might get lost in a certain direction and therefore encounter certain features on the map. Under a more meticulous system, being lost adds progress in a different direction, thus necessitating a new calculation for travel time.</p>
<p>After logging progress, everyone rolls for forage (unless the party traveled at a fast pace). Characters that failed have to consume one ration for the day. If the whole party fails to forage, then the personal water reserves aren't replenished. Note that extra water reserves the party might have are only replenished if there are significant bodies of water in the environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the night time encounters play out. Assume everyone keeps watch for equal amounts of time and roll randomly to see who is awake. If the enemy spots the camp, then the awake character must succeed on a Perception check to avoid an ambush.</p>
<h4>Falling</h4>
<p>When a creature falls, it takes <span class="crsh">1d6 crushing damage</span> for every 3m of descent, up to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it has avoided damage from falling.</p>
<h4>Magic Items</h4>
<p>In order to learn what a magic item does, the most reliable way is to cast an <i>Identify</i> spell on it (either yourself, or by hiring the services of a local wizard). The other option is to spend a short rest investigating the item (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). You roll a DC Perception 12 (certain artifacts might require more). If you fail, you learn nothing, though you can always try again later. If you succeed, then you learn the item's properties, except for those that aren't readily apparent (subtle curses, long-term effects, or the personality quirks of the item, if it's intelligent - though you can glean it's alignment; all these properties only become apparent after you bond with the item).</p>
<p>In order to use a magic item, you must bond with it, which means spending a short rest, concentrating on the item, uninterrupted (thus negating all other benefits of a short rest). Once this is done, you can access all of the item's properties (as well as its downsides...).</p>
<p>An item can be bonded to only one creature at a time. A creature cannot bond with two magic items of the same type (eg two magical swords) at any given time, and you can bond to only one item during a short rest.</p>
<p>Your bond to an item ends when the item has been more than 100m away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your bond to an item with another short rest. Some items, however, are cursed and cannot be relinquished without completing some special requirements first, that depend on the nature of the curse.</p>


<br/><h1 id="downtime">Down Time</h1>
<p>Down time can cover hours or even days of activity. The party is generally not engaged in immediate activities and tend to be focused on long-term tasks such as crafting, research, training, building reputations, or carousing.</p>


<br/><h1 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h1>
<p>The magic performed by mortals is tightly bound by arbitrary rules that few understand and none can avoid. A spell does nothing more and nothing less that what it says in its description. Therefore, while magic can certainly be used in creative ways, a spell can never do more than what it is defined to do.</p>
<p>To cast a spell, one requires the use of his/her voice in order to speak the words of power, as well as a free hand to perform intricate magic symbols and channel the effect towards its target. If a caster is gagged, silenced, has its hands bound such that the fingers can't move, or has no free hand, then he/she cannot perform magic. If a caster's hands are merely bound, but the fingers are free to move, then he/she can still cast magic, but can only direct it where his/her hands are pointing.</p>
<p>If wielding a two-handed weapon, you can freely use one hand to cast a spell while the other holds the weapon. If holding two weapons, or a weapon and a shield, however, your only recourse is to either sheathe the weapon (free action), drop it (free action, but grasping it again takes a full action) or doff the shield (one action).</p>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell.</p>
<p>The effects of the same spell don't overlap if the spell is cast multiple times on the same target. Different spells can overlap, however.</p>
<h4>Spell slots</h4>
<p>Excepting a select few characters that posses the ability of innate spellcasting, everyone needs to spend a spell slot of an equal or higher level to the spell one desires to cast. Cantrips, or 0 level spells, are an exception to this rule, as they are so easy, and so well practiced by the magic user, that they can be employed at will.</p>
<p>A spell always assumes the level of the slot used to cast it. A spell may thus assume a higher level and become more powerful (consult the spell's description for specifics).</p>
<p>Some spells can be cast as a ritual, provided that they have the ritual tag in their description. In this form, the spell takes 10 minutes per level to cast, but it doesn't consume a spell slot (this, however, means that a ritual spell's level can't be increased). The magic user needs a special trait in order to cast rituals and, unless specified otherwise, the caster needs to have the spell prepared (check class description for specifics on spell preparing).</p>
<h4 id="epicRitual">Epic Ritual</h4>
<p>Certain powerful magics (imprisoning very powerful entities, opening a permanent gateway to another plane of existence) can only be worked through epic rituals, which require a tremendous amount of power and preparation to be cast. Epic rituals are considered to be level 10 spells, thus impossible to cast by ordinary means. The caster must have a trait allowing him/her to cast an epic ritual, and all his spell slots must be intact. It takes 2 hours to perform such a ritual, and at its end the caster expends all of his spell slots.</p>
<h4>Material Components</h4>
<p>Some spells require rare (and expensive) materials, which are are not consumed during the casting unless the spell description notes otherwise. If a component is consumed, it is reduced to very fine dust as its powers are absorbed into the spell. A spellcaster needs a free hand to use material components, but this is assumed to be the hand used to draw the gestures required for the spell.</p>
<h4>Spell Scrolls</h4>
<p>A spell scroll is a thick parchment imbued with magical power, filled with arcane markings that sometimes cover both sides of the scroll. Any creature that is trained in Arcana can attempt to use a spell scroll, but this is a delicate operation that might fail for those not steeped in the ways of magic. You must use an action to activate the scroll and cast its spell, regardless of its usual cast time or personal abilities (a sorcerer cannot use metamagic on a spell cast from a scroll). If the spell is not on your class's spell list, or not of a level you can cast, then you must roll Intelligence (Arcana) vs 10 + spell level. Failure carries no consequence outside the wasted time.</p>
<p>The creation of a spell scroll is an expensive and time-consuming process, where the slightest error can derail the whole process. An Intelligence (Arcana) check is required to successfully craft a scroll. If the check fails, then the money and time are wasted regardless. The cost is detailed in the table below (it does not include the required material components, which must be provided at creation), as are the spellpower values for the spell. These values don't depend on the caster, for the spell magic is imbued into the scroll.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>Rarity</th><th>Spellpower</th><th>Craft Cost</th><th>Arcana DC to craft</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Common</td><td>+3</td><td>250 gg, 1 day</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Uncommon</td><td>+4</td><td>500 gg, 2 days</td><td>12</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Legendary</td><td>+10</td><td>64 GK, 20 days</td><td>24</td></tr>
</table>
<br/><h4 id="concentration">Concentration</h4>
<p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
<p>The following situations remove a spellcaster's concentration: casting another spell that requires concentration, casting a spell whose casting time is longer than one action or being incapacitated or killed. When taking damage, the spellcaster must roll Constitution vs max(10, damage/2) to maintain his concentration. At the GM's discretion, other disruptive events (such as an unexpected loud noise, an earth-shattering explosion, or a scary apparition) may also require the character to roll to maintain concentration.</p>
<h4>Area of effect</h4>
<p>Spells with an area of effect have a point of origin and a shape along which the effect manifests itself. If there's an obstacle that provides full cover between a creature and the point of origin, that creature is safe from the effects of the spell. When playing on squares, a spell affects a square provided that its area of effect overlaps half of more of that square.</p>
<p><b><i>Cone.</i></b> A cone's width at any point is equal to the distance to its point of origin, which isn't included in the area of effect, unless you decide so. When playing on squares, a row at distance N from the point of origin is affected on a width of N (if N is odd) or N-1 (if N is even). (Other fractions of squares are also technically affected, but any creature in such a square has plenty of space to dodge)</p>
<p><b><i>Cube.</i></b> The point of origin lies on the side of the cube and isn't included in the area of effect unless you decide so.</p>
<p><b><i>Cylinder.</i></b> The point of origin lies at the base of the cylinder and is included in the area of effect. The cylinder has a radius, as well as height.</p>
<p><b><i>Sphere.</i></b> The sphere extends outwards from its point of origin. Unless the character specifically mentions otherwise (and the spell allows it), the sphere's center is considered to lie on the ground. Thus, its area of effect will be that of a circle with the sphere's radius.</p>
<h4>Schools of Magic</h4>
<p>In the oldest days of recorded history, magicians agreed that spells should be categorized according to the level upon which it acted: Materium (the physical world), Aetherium (energy) or Aidos (the mind, the soul and the other highest concepts that could not be readily explained). They then further divided magic according to its source of power. More recently, however, ingenious archmages have proved that, at least empirically, there is no measurable difference in the effects of magic that depend on its source. Therefore, a new classification was adopted, based solely on what the spell affects and what the end result is.</p>
<p>While stubborn hold-outs remain, especially among clerics, who like to imagine that their divine magic is somehow better, the vast majority of the scholars agree that magic can be neatly divided into eight schools:</p>
<p><b><i>Abjuration</i></b> spells are sometimes called anti-magic, since its most important use is to cancel other magic or stop its effects. It is a category of protective spells, that can create magical barriers, remove harmful magics, stop trespassers, or banish creatures to their home plane of existence.</p>
<p><b><i>Animancy</i></b> deals with the mysterious energies of life and death (biotic and necrotic energy, which stand in opposition to one another). Such spells can heal as well as harm, transfer life energy from a creature to another, resurrect the dead, or even animate their corpses using the forces of death. While massively helpful, some cultures consider parts of it or even the entire field as taboo, since it manipulates forces some consider are not meant for the mortals to tamper with. Necromancy in particular, meaning the use of necrotic energy, is shunned or outright banned in most of the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Conjuration</i></b> spells involve the creation and destruction of matter in all its forms. Most often it is used to create useful objects, harmful materials that can be thrown or dropped on enemies, to summon helpful creatures, but it can also be used to unmake and remake an object in different places, thus providing an instantaneous mode of travel. Conjuration deals exclusively with the Materium.</p>
<p><b><i>Divination</i></b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. It works in Aidos, particularly in the areas over which mortals have yet gleaned little knowledge. As such, it is the least understood and least appreciated of the schools of magic.</p>
<p><b><i>Noumancy</i></b> is all about the mind (Nous) and thoughts. Also called mind magic or enchantment by those less inclined to academic terms, it covers spells that affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Needless to say, its use is highly controversial and highly regulated if not outright banned in many civilizations. Less scrupulous wizards often hide behind the academic term as a means to lessen scrutiny from those less informed.</p>
<p><b><i>Protomancy</i></b> spells create and manipulate energy, either in its direct form or refined as fire, frost or lightning. While there are some peaceful applications of this energy, it is most often employed in the utter destruction of one's enemies, with bolts, beams or exploding balls. Protomancy is spectacular and often the first thing people associate with magic, but it is also dangerous to those who do not tread carefully with its power.</p>
<p><b><i>Umbramancy</i></b> is the art of controlling the energies of Shadow and Light, one drawn from the Moon, the other drawn from the Sun. Umbramantic spells hold great sway over sight, and some lesser power over sound. They cause people to see things that aren't there or to hear phantom noises, or they obscure or warp their perception of reality. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious spells manipulate the very sight of a creature so that it is completely ruptured from reality. Despite the bad name it gets, Umbramancy is equally powerful with the Light, and it can also be used to unburden sight of the thickest veils.</p>
<p><b><i>Transmutation</i></b> spells alter the properties of a substance that already exists, ranging from simple or subtle changes to those that make the original barely recognizable. They might transform a creature into a different one, bolster or sap the abilities of a creature, apply forces on an object to make it move or twist, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>

<h4>Coinage</h4>
<p>Generally, every realm has its own form of currency, sometimes not even employing precious metal coins. However, coins are well received everywhere, except in cases where one tries to pay with the currency of a hostile power, or where there is reason to suspect the coins are not genuine. Therefore, to keep matters simple, a player's wealth will be tracked in grams of gold, regardless of the type of currencies the character is actually carrying around. Only if the GM specifically determines a certain currency to not be readily acceptable to merchants should it be registered separately.</p>
<p>Each realm's coin is worth a certain grams of gold, depending on size and the material it is crafted from (generally gold of varying purity, but silver is also common, as are devalued coins with cores made of copper; commoners in developed nations may use copper or bronze coins of meager worth for small transactions; some wealthy merchant cities may mint very valuable platinum coins to ease large transactions). These values are determined by the setting or the campaign document and they remain constant unless specifically noted.</p>
<p>The value of goods fluctuates with varying economic circumstances, but this chapter provides a list of normal prices, that will be used unless a campaign document sets different prices (eg. a shortage of iron leads to doubled prices for swords and iron armor). The lowest price in use is 0.01 gg (gold grams), the value of the lowest denomination copper pieces and of small everyday items: a candle, a loaf of bread, a bowl of soup, etc. A day laborer earns 0.1 gg for eight hours of work, while a skilled craftsman will earn 1 gg, or even more. Treasure hoards and national ledgers may sometimes work with gold in the kilograms; in these rare instances, 1 GK (gold kilograms) = 1000 gg.</p>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<p>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any check you make that involves Strength or Dexterity, attacks against your Firmness/Reflex have advantage, and you can't cast spells.</p>
<p>Heavier armor may interfere with the wearer's ability to move quickly or stealthily. If the Armor table shows a Strength requirement, then the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 2 squares unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the requirement. The Impairs Stealth column indicates whether the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks while wearing this armor (some armors are rather clunky or noisy and ill suited for sneaking).</p>

<p><b><i>Gambeson.</i></b> Made from several layers of heavy fabric, stuffed with horse hair to provide resilience. The end result is not only light and comfortable, but also offers a fair degree of protection and can absorb most glancing blows.</p>
<p><b><i>Boiled leather.</i></b> When boiled, animal leather can become really tough. Strips of hardened leather are sown on top of a gambeson, thus providing increased protection, although this improvement is quite expensive. The result is hardy but flexible armor, although one that is difficult to repair.</p>
<p><b><i>Hide.</i></b> Employed by wild tribes who lack advanced craftsmanship, hide armor simply involves layers of thick furs sewn together in a primitive armor, perhaps with some hardened leather protecting vital organs. It can be quite stifling to wear, but it offers good protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Jack of plates.</i></b> A jack of plates is a gambeson that has pieces of metal sewn inside. Since the metal can be recycled from broken or discarded armor, weapons and tools, this is a fairly cheap type of armor that is greatly favored in poorer regions.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain shirt.</i></b> Made of countless interlocking rings of metal, a chain shirt offers really good protection against anything save a well aimed piercing weapon pushed straight through a gap. It is the standard armor of most respectable warriors, as it is both very protective and reasonably priced. Chain shirts are always worn over a gambeson to prevent chafing and to lessen bludgeoning hits.</p>
<p><b><i>Brigandine.</i></b> This armor combines a chain shirt with a thick tunic that has metal bands riveted to it. The result is highly resilient, even to piercing attacks, and fairly heavy blows are needed to pierce this armor. Not everyone can afford a good brigandine, however.</p>
<p><b><i>Breastplate.</i></b> Two solid metal pieces, one for the back and one for the front, tied together with leather straps (and usually also tied to a gambeson undergarment). Little can penetrate the breastplate, its only weakness being that it leaves the arms and legs unprotected. This is the highest level of protection a warrior can get without sacrificing agility in combat.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain mail.</i></b> Similar to the chain shirt, except that this is a suit that covers the entire body, even the head, for excellent all around protection.</p>
<p><b><i>Reinforced chain.</i></b> Same as the chain mail, except that there is a round metal plate protecting the chest from penentrating blows, metal bracers and greaves, as well as a solid metal helmet that helps defend the head and neck.</p>
<p><b><i>Plate.</i></b> The best protection money can buy, shy of magical armor. This whole body suit consists of metal plates that cover every possible part of the body, with only minimal weaknesses to be found in the joints.</p>
<h4>Getting into and out of armor</h4>
<p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category. If you have help, reduce this time by half.</p>
<p><b><i>Don.</i></b> This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's stats only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes for medium armor, 10 minutes for heavy armor, and 1 action for a shield.</p>
<p><b><i>Doff.</i></b> This is the time it takes to take off armor. It takes one minute to doff light or medium armor, 5 minutes for heavy armor, and 1 action for a shield.</p>
<h4>Improvised Weapons</h4>
<p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon means any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. If the weapon is reasonably similar to a weapon, then it behaves as that weapon in all respects (for example, a table leg is as good as a club).</p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 2 damage (or whatever the GM deems appropriate). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown tag, it also deals 2 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 4 squares and a long range of 12 squares.</p>
<p>In case of extreme emergency, one can even use one's bare fists (which naturally can follow the <a href="#dualWield">dual wielding rules</a>), but a fist does a mere 1 + Strength crushing damage.</p>

<h4>Weapon Tags</h4>
<p><b><i>Strength/Dexterity.</i></b> The weapon uses this attribute to determine bonus to hit rolls.</p>
<p><b><i>Ammunition.</i></b> This weapon expends one unit of ammunition to use in a ranged attack. Ammunition can be partially recovered after a battle if a character spends around a minute retrieving it - restock half of the expended ammunition.</p>
<p><b><i>Heavy.</i></b> Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
<p><b><i>Light.</i></b> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when <a href="#dualWield">fighting with two weapons</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Loading.</i></b> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, quick action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>
<p><b><i>Range.</i></b> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown tag. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's maximum range.</p>
<p><b><i>Reach.</i></b> This melee weapon can attack within 2 squares (10 feet) of you.</p>
<p><b><i>Thrown.</i></b> Can be used as both ranged and melee weapon, with the same stats.</p>
<p><b><i>Two-handed.</i></b> This weapon requires both hands to use.</p>
<p><b><i>Unwieldy.</i></b> You have disadvantage on attacking targets within 1 square (5 feet) of you.</p>
<p><b><i>Versatile.</i></b> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. The value in parantheses is the damage done when wielding the weapon with two hands.</p>

<h4>Adventuring Equipment</h4>
<p><b><i>Acid Flask.</i></b> 20 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. The target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Alchemist's Fire.</i></b> 25 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Antitoxin.</i></b> 50 gg. Poison attacks against a creature that drinks this vial of liquid are rolled with disadvantage for 1 hour. If the creature is poisoned when drinking the potion, the effect is removed, but the potion has no further effect.</p>
<p><b><i>Block and Tackle.</i></b> 1 gg. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>
<p><b><i>Caltrops.</i></b> 1 gg. As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 1x1 square area. For a creature to traverse the area, it must either move at half speed, or pass a DC 15 Acrobatics check. Failing that, the creature stops moving and takes 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hp, its walking speed is reduced by 2 squares.</p>
<p><b><i>Candle.</i></b> 0.01 gg. For one hour, the candle provides bright light for 1 square, and dim light for a further square.</p>
<p><b><i>Chain.</i></b> 5 gg. It's 6m long, can hold 200 kg before bursting can be broken with a DC 18 Strength check.</p>
<p><b><i>Climber's anchor and rope.</i></b> 2 gg. This anchor is a long and sturdy steel piton, that can be hammered into a rock cliff, thereby anchoring you to it. As long as you keep the rope tied around your waist, you cannot fall more than 6m below the anchor.</p>
<p><b><i>Crowbar.</i></b> 2 gg. Using a crowbar where its leverage can be applied grants advantage to Strength checks.</p>
<p><b><i>Holy Water.</i></b> 25 gg. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within a square of you, or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 7 radiant damage.</p>
<p>Any cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. For one flask, the ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 24 gg worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>
<p>Death Water is the reverse of Holy Water, created by clerics that serve evil Deities to serve against celestials and fey. When used against such creatures, it deals 7 necrotic damage.</p>
<p><b><i>Herbalism Kit.</i></b> 10 gg. Contains a mortar and pestle and a variety of glasses and vials needed to prepare herbs into potions, ointments and other varied remedies.</p>
<p><b><i>Hunting Trap.</i></b> 5 gg. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. When a creature steps on the plate, the trap makes a +3 attack vs Reflex. On a successful attack, the victim takes 2 piercing damage and cannot move anymore. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 1m long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check to open the trap and free its captive. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>
<p><b><i>Ink (vial with 30 grams of ink).</i></b> 10 gg. Vital if one wants to write on a parchment with something more elegant (and less painful) than one's own blood. For more crude purposes, a chalk worth 0.01 gg might be more appropriate. A sheet of parchment costs 0.1 gg, while the highly prized paper costs 0.2 gg.</p>
<p><b><i>Lamp.</i></b> 0.5 gg. Casts a bright light in a 3 square radius, and dim light for a further 6 squares. It uses a flask of oil and burns for about 6 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Lantern.</i></b> 15 gg. Has a bullseye that directs light in a bright cone facing forwards. It casts a bright light for 12 squares, and dim light for an additional 12 squares. It also has a hood that can be lowered, so that the lantern only gives off dim light in 1 square. It uses a flask of oil and burns for about 6 hours.</p>
<p><b><i>Manacles.</i></b> 2 gg. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 16 Mechanics check. The chain binding the manacles can be severed using a heavy weapon, or by brute force (DC 20 Strength check).</p>
<p><b><i>Medicine Kit.</i></b> 6 gg. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hp, with advantage on the Medicine check. A character that suceeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) Check can also expend one use of the kit to boost a character's recovery during a short rest: that character gains +1 on every Hit Die roll.</p>
<p><b><i>Net.</i></b> 1 gg. Attacks like a martial ranged weapon, with a range of 1/3 squares. A Large or smaller creature hit by the net is <a href="conditions/restrained.html">restrained</a> until it is freed. The net will not work on creatures that are formless or do not have a physical body. A victim can use its action to roll Dexterity (Escape Artist) vs 12 to escape. Alternatively, it (or a friend) can cut its way out with a slashing weapon (Deflection 10, at least 5 damage). A friend can also roll Dexterity (Escape Artist) vs 10 to free the victim.</p>
<p><b><i>Oil Flask.</i></b> 0.1 gg. As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within a square of you or throw it up to 4 squares, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (10 rounds), the target takes an additional 1d10 fire damage from the burning oil and is set <a href="conditions/on_fire.html">ablaze</a>. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 1x1 square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Poison, Basic.</i></b> 25 gg. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. If you hit a creature with a poisoned weapon, roll +4 vs Endurance; on success, deal an additional 1d6 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 10 rounds before drying.</p>
<p><b><i>Potion of Mending.</i></b> 40 gg. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points.</p>
<p><b><i>Potion of Healing.</i></b> 80 gg. A character who drinks the magical bright red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 9 hit points.</p>
<p><b><i>Quiver.</i></b> 1 gg, 20 arrows or 20 crossbow bolts or 40 blowgun needles or 500 stone sling bullets, or 20 lead sling bullets (+1).</p>
<p><b><i>Rope.</i></b> 0.5 gg. It's 6m long, can safely hold 120 kg can be burst with a DC 15 Strength check.</p>
<p><b><i>Spellbook.</i></b> 100 gg. A wizard's most essential companion. Losing it means losing all one's spells, as this spellbook is completely blank!</p>
<p><b><i>Thieves' Tools.</i></b> 25 gg. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. They tools are required in order to disarm traps, pick locks, or tinker with mechanical devices.</p>
<p><b><i>Torch.</i></b> 0.01 gg. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 4 square radius and dim light for an additional 4 squares. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 2 crushing + 1 extra fire damage.</p>
<h4 id="equipmentPacks">Equipment Packs</h4>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. These packs may also be bought at specialized shops, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.</p>
<p><b><i>Burglar's Pack (16 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a bag of ball bearings, two ropes, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 climbing anchors and rope, a lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days of rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><b><i>Diplomat's Pack (39 gg).</i></b> Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, sealing wax, and soap.</p>
<p><b><i>Dungeoneer's Pack (12 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a crowbar, a hammer, a rope, 10 climbing anchors and rope, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><b><i>Entertainer's Pack (40 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 2 costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a disguise kit.</p>
<p><b><i>Explorer's Pack (10 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, a rope, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><b><i>Priest's Pack (19 gg).</i></b> Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin.</p>
<p><i><b>Scholar's Pack (40 gg).</b></i> Includes a backpack, a book of lore, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a little bag of sand, and a small knife.</p>
<h4>Living Expenses</h4>
<p>When not out in the dungeon or wilderness, you need a place to stay, a hot meal to eat, and perhaps some drink to go along. A comfortable night in a reputable inn, covering good food, drink, and a comfortable bed, costs 1 gg per person. Stingy characters might want to spend less, by going to less reputable establishments, but this exposes them to a real risk of mugging, violence or disease at the GM's discretion.</p>
<p>Of course, characters may also choose to reward themselves after a hard day's work, and pay for better lodgings or even lavish parties. This is quite beneficial in striking up relations with the important persons of the day, but it guarantees no gameplay bonus.</p>
