<br/><k>Features &amp; Traits</k><br/>
<b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares (18m) of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
<b><i>Hellish Resistance.</i></b> You have resistance to fire damage.<br/>
<b><i>Infernal Legacy.</i></b> You know the <a href="../spells/thaumaturgy.html">thaumaturgy</a> cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/hellish_rebuke.html">hellish rebuke</a> spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the <a href="../spells/darkness.html">darkness</a> spell once per day.<br/>
<b><i>Divine Sense.</i></b> The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 12 squares (18m) of you. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <i>hallow</i> spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.<br/>
<b><i>Lay on Hands.</i></b> Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hp to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.<br/>
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hp from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hp separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.<br/>
<b><i>Great Weapon Fighting.</i></b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a two-handed or versatile weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.<br/>
<b><i>Divine Smite.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.<br/>
