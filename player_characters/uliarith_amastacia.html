<br/><k>Features &amp; Traits</k><br/>
<b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Accustomed to twilit forest and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 12 squares (18m) of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br/>
<b><i>Fey Ancestry.</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.<br/>
<b><i>Trance.</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.<br/>
<b><i>Mask of the Wild.</i></b> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br/>
<b><i>Ritual Casting.</i></b> You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.<br/>
<b><i>Wild Shape.</i></b> You can use your bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into. At level 2 you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. At level 4 you can choose a beast with a CR of 1 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. At level 6 you can choose any beast with a CR of druid level/3 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. At level 8 you can also choose beasts with flying speed.<br/>
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hp, or die.<br/>
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
  <li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hp. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hp you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hp, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hp, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>
  <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.</li>
  <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
  <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Combat Wild Shape.</i></b> While you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hp per level of the spell slot expended.<br/>
