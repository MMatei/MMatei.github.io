  <h3>Blinded</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> The creature:
  <ul>
    <li>can't see, so it automatically fails all checks requiring sight</li>
    <li>can't take the Disengage action</li>
    <li>moves at half speed</li>
    <li>has disadvantage on attacking Deflection</li>
    <li>attacks on its Deflection, Reflex have advantage</li>
   </ul>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> The creature's sight must be restored; that may be as simple as removing a blindfold, or it might require <a href="../spells/lesser_restoration.html">lesser restoration</a>, for magical blindness. If the creature's eyes have been put out, then only <a href="../spells/regenerate.html">regenerate</a> can grow them back and remove blindness (or perhaps some magical eyes...).
