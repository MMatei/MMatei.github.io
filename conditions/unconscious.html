  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> An unconscious creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak and is unaware of its surroundings. The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and all melee attacks inflict critical damage.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> Depends on the reason for falling unconscious.
