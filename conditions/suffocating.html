  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for half a round per point of Constitution (rounded up). After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 CON in order to continue holding her breath. The save must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following round, she drops to -1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she suffocates.<br/>
  <b><i>Slow Suffocation.</b></i> A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber 3 meters square. After that time, the character is suffocating, per the above. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters. A larger volume of air, of course, lasts for a longer time.
