  <h3>Suffocating</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> A creature who has no air to breathe can hold its breath for half a round per point of Constitution (rounded up). After this period of time, the creature must make a DC 10 Con in order to continue holding its breath. The save must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the creature fails one of these Constitution checks, it falls to 0 hp and becomes unconscious. In every subsequent round, it automatically fails its death saving throw.<br/>
  <b><i>Slow Suffocation.</b></i> A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber 3 meters square. After that time, the character is suffocating, per the above. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters. A larger volume of air, of course, lasts for a longer time.
