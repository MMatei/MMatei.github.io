  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> Cannot be seen except by magical means, though the presence of the creature may be guessed from the sounds it makes or footprints that it leaves behind. Unless an enemy has a specific way of pinpointing the creature, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against it, and the creature can attack the enemy with advantage.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> Depends on the conditions of invisibility.
