  <h3>Poisoned</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the creature reaches 0 hp while poisoned, it becomes <a href="paralyzed.html">paralyzed</a> for an hour even if it regains hp.<br/>
  If a creature has become intoxicated with alcohol or some drug with similar effects, consider the creature to be poisoned.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> <i>Lesser restoration</i> or more powerful magic, or an appropriate potion. If 'poisoned' with alcohol, then sufficient rest will remove the condition.
