  <h3>Petrified</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, the creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saves, the creature has resistance to all damage, and is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> <i>Greater restoration</i> or more powerful magic.
