  <h3>Exhaustion</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> Exhaustion is measured in six levels of increasing gravity. A creature suffers the effects of its current level of exhaustion as well as the effect of the lower levels. The exhaustion levels are:<br/>
  <ol>
	  <li>Speed halved.</li>
      <li>Disadvantage on ability checks.</li>
	  <li>Disadvantage on all rolls and -5 to defenses.</li>
	  <li>Max hp halved.</li>
	  <li>Speed reduced to 0.</li>
	  <li>Death.</li>
  </ol>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> A long rest reduces exhaustion by one level, provided that the character has had sufficient food and drink. Other effects may also reduce exhaustion by a specified number of levels.
