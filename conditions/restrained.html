  <h3>Restrained</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> The creature:
  <ul>
    <li>cannot move and cannot benefit from bonuses to speed</li>
    <li>has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saves</li>
    <li>attacks against it have advantage</li>
  </ul>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> Depends on what is restraining the creature, but generally the creature can break free with a Str check, or can be helped out by an ally. It might also be possible to wiggle free with a Dex check, or to cut the restraints with a melee weapon attack.
