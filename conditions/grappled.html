  <h3>Grappled</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> The creature can't move and enemies attacking its AC have advantage on their roll. The creature moves along with the grappler, whose speed is halved unless it is at least two sizes larger.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> A successful Force/Escape Artist check against STR save, or if the grappler is incapacitated, or as a result of an effect that throws the creature away from the grappler's grasp.
