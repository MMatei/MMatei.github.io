  <h3>On Fire</h3>
  <b><i>Effects.</b></i> The character takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn and (only if it can be frightened) it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. There is likely a good deal of screaming involved.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal.</b></i> DC 10 Dex to put the fire out. Alternatively, roll on the ground to put it out, but it leaves you prone. The best option, of course, is to be doused in water. The fire will burn out after 10 rounds and the condition ends.
