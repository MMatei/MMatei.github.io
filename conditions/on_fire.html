  <h3>On Fire</h3>
  <b><i>Effects:</b></i> Creatures that are immune to fire cannot be set on fire. The character takes <span class="fire">1d4 fire damage</span> at the start of its turn and (only if it can be frightened) it has disadvantage on all rolls. There is likely a good deal of screaming involved.<br/>
  <b><i>Removal:</b></i> So long as the fire isn't magical, being doused in water or rolling on the ground will put it out (but the latter option leaves you prone). Otherwise, the fire will burn out after 10 rounds and the condition ends.
